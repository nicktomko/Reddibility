INSERT INTO `qadata` VALUES (1,'BobMetcalfe',' I want to ask you one of our final exam questions: What would happen if all of the Internet was simply an Ethernet with switches, and MAC addresses were used instead of IP addresses?  And one more question: do you think more efficient multiple access protocols can/will be invented in the future?','Have heard from those still in the packet plumbing industry that the trend is back from Internet routing toward Ethernet switching.  Have no dog in that hunt.  Ethernet was first designed to be LAN packet plumbing for the Internet.  Have been predicting for years that TCP/IP/Ethernet would be replaced by some version of lambda switching, but that has not happened and Im not sure what that means anyway.  The trend was away from multi-access for a while, with the reemergence of wiring hubs, but then along came WiFi and LTE.  ',0),(2,'BobMetcalfe','You invented a product which is used extensively around the world and yet many people (me included) had no idea who you were (sorry). Do you find this annoying?','Am quite famous among my people, networking nerds.  Thats enough for me.  On the other hand, who is Katy Perry?',0),(3,'BobMetcalfe','What are your thoughts on Google Fiber (as its coming to Austin soon)?  And what, exactly, sparked your interest in communications?','Google Fiber is great news for everyone, especially as a spur to AT&amp;T and Comcast and Time Warner et al.  Competition!  We are now gigafying the Internet -- build it and they (new apps) will come, so far anyway.  Got interested in communications because thats what ARPA was funding the year I started grad school in 1969. ',0),(4,'BobMetcalfe','High, im sitting in class browsing reddit thanks to you, how do you feel your invention has impacted the younger generation?','Close your PC and pay attention to the professor.  And do not get me started on ageism with this  younger generation  stuff.  Anyway, we used to have a lot of electronics in our dorm rooms at college back in the 1960s, but those were stereo systems.',0),(5,'BobMetcalfe','What was your protocol review / update process?  How did you know which layers would change, especially when considering industrial production lines of different CPUs?    How can we use a similar approach to incorporate future network variables?','The layering of Internet protocols is its greatest invention.  Layering has allowed me to live a rich full life at layers 1 and 2 while a bunch of other people got to play above me without permission.  All that serendipity.  Ethernet and TCP/IP were invented in 1973 in Palo Alto, where I am this second, and the World Wide Web was not invented until 1989 and the plumbing still worked.  Whoa, dude! ',0),(6,'BobMetcalfe','Thank you for doing this AMA! What are your thoughts on the future of Internet privacy and government control of information?','Trust governments to invade your privacy.  We must use tools to keep our stuff a secret.  Am not expert on this, but I do mail all my financial secrets to the IRS through the USPS every April 15th trusting that no USPS union member or IRS agent will peek. Oy.',0),(7,'BobMetcalfe',' I meant to ask you this but I never got the chance, out of all of the careers youve had so far, which has been your favorite and most rewarding?','Five careers, not counting 23 years as a student: engineer-scientist, entrepreneur-executive (when my company grew too big), publisher-pundit, venture capitalist, not professor of innovation.  Favorite?  All so different, they defy comparison.  Just another 7.5 years to next career.',0),(8,'BobMetcalfe','What is your preferred color of Ethernet cable?   A sweet royal blue?   Canary yellow?','Yellow is the official Ethernet cable color, in my mind.  I wonder if IEEE has a spec on that.',0),(9,'BobMetcalfe','How badass does it make you feel to be able to honestly say  I invented Ethernet ?','For some values of I, invented, and Ethernet, I can honestly say that I invented Ethernet.  But so can a lot of other people.  Proud, yes.  Also, wildly curious about where this monster goes next.',0),(10,'BobMetcalfe','Did you make a lot of money off the invention?','Did not make my Ethernet money on patent royalties, but by SELLING Ethernet for a decade to people who didnt know they needed it. ',0),(11,'BobMetcalfe','Do you think someone else could have done it at the time?','Yes, but they didnt.  I was lucky to be born to my parents, to accidentally get accepted to MIT, to sneak into Xerox Parc, and lucky to get the completely new problem of having a building full of personal computers, one on every desk, if you can imagine.',0),(12,'BobMetcalfe','What are your feelings towards Bill Gates?','Great man.  It would be very hard to find someone else better at being the richest man on Earth.  Bill may not like me for going after Microsoft for its anti-competitive practices during the 1990s, but I meant no harm.',0),(13,'BobMetcalfe','When the internet first became a thing, did you think porn would have such a huge part of it?','What?! Porn on the Internet?  Ethernet filters out porn.',0),(14,'BobMetcalfe','What do you think of Google?','Wish I had thought of that.  As a professor of innovation, I like Google especially because of its  pivot  from fast search to auctioned targeted advertising.  Google unseated Microsoft which unseated IBM.  Who will unseat Google?  Cannot wait to see how that plays out.',0),(15,'BobMetcalfe','Have you ever worked with Sir Tim Berners-Lee?','Sir Tim holds the 3Com Founders Chair at MIT, where I am a Life Trustee, so I bump into Sir Tim now and then, like at SXSW when he came to Austin.  He is like Gandhi with ADD.',0),(16,'BobMetcalfe','Was token ring a better technology than Ethernet back in the day when both were in use?','No.  Even though our beloved IEEE 802 standardized IBM Token Ring, having sold it myself, I can say it was never really open (had SNA dust all over it), and it was slow and expensive compared to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet.  IBM never really got how to be an open standard during the LAN Wars. ',0),(17,'BobMetcalfe','Hey bob my question is looking back on how much the internet has progressed over the years did you have a different purpose for it?','The Internet intelligentsia from the 1970s are outraged at the newbies who have dared to use the Internet for purposes completely unintended, like advertising, like YouTube.  Tough.  I cannot wait to see the next big new applications enabled by the Gigabit Internet.  Connectivity is good.',0),(18,'BobMetcalfe','What do you think the most positive impact the internet has had on society as a whole?','The Internet reduces market frictions and expands freedom of choice.  I give the Internet credit for everything good that has happened since 1969. ',0),(19,'BobMetcalfe','How do you deal with challenging people or situations?  What is the best advice someone told you?','God (or Darwin) gave us one mouth and two ears.  Take the hint.  Best to listen first.  Summarize back with the language youve heard.  Then, act!',0),(20,'BobMetcalfe','What is your biggest pet peeve?','That nobody ever changes their mind. ',0),(21,'BobMetcalfe','What is the best/biggest thing youve done or witnessed as a Member of the MIT Corporation?','Attending MIT trustee meetings is the most fun you can have standing up.  Recent excitement was the debut of the MOOC edX, which is going to help the Internet disrupt education the way that iTunes disrupted music and Amazon disrupted books, or BOOCs as I call them.',0),(22,'BobMetcalfe','Hi Bob, can you to speak to new markets that Ethernet will be expanding to?','Ethernet is going up, into, over, across, and down into new markets.  Up toward terabit LAN.  Into the WAN killing SONET.  Over the airwaves as WiFi.  Across the telechasm, between carrier WANs and customer LANs, as Carrier Ethernet.  And won into embedded networking, as ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4).',0),(23,'BobMetcalfe',' before hand it was never even thought of?','The terminal on my desk at Xerox Parc was communicating at 300bps the day before we installed an Alto PC and CSMA/CD Ethernet running at 2.94Mbps, which is about 10,000 times faster.  We went that fast because we could, and because our new laser printer could consume 20Mbps.',1),(24,'BobMetcalfe','Do you get royalties on your invention?','I made a play to get a buck per Ethernet node, but had to settle for a penny per packet.',0),(25,'BobMetcalfe','What are your views on American government trying to censor and control the way people use the internet?','Governments should leave the Internet alone. ',0),(26,'BobMetcalfe','Do you think the claims that the internet reduces actual communication and devalues some of the things that used to define society are valid?','No.  But I think the theres good stuff on TV, more good stuff than before, despite all the crap.  Good thing we have search.',0),(27,'BobMetcalfe','How do I send data into the future?','Just leave data lying around, and it will get to the future automatically. ',1),(28,'BobMetcalfe','What do you think separates intellectual innovators from the rest of the population, for example, Mark with Facebook?  What prompts the mind to such great ideas , or new innovations?  In other words, what advice would you have for an undergrad that wants to make things that literally change the world?','Innovations depend much on context, and so it helps to be at the right place at the right time, as Zuckerberg is.  But then you have to be skilled enough and ambitious enough to act, as Zuckerberg has.',0),(29,'BobMetcalfe','com/?','To join in the celebration of Ethernets 40th Birthday -- gather innovation lessons, sing the unsung heroes, party -- go to http://www.facebook.com/Ethernet40thAnniversaryIEEESA ',0),(30,'BobMetcalfe','Wish more people understood just how versatile ethernet is. What are your thoughts on FCoE vs iSCSI when transmitting data for storage products?','Ethernet vs Ethernot usually ends up Ethernet.  The Network Effect (as quantified by Metcalfes Law) plus all the Ethernet infrastructure that has accumulated over 40 years.  Remember, RS232C circa 1962 is still out there.',0),(31,'BobMetcalfe','if you are confident you wont have to eat your words, any new predictions?','Better to eat my words than someone elses.  I make 10 predictions per day.  My batting average is above .500.  Yall of course remember the big ones I got wrong.',0),(32,'BobMetcalfe','Why didnt you make it so that the packet preamble couldnt be reproduced in the packet payload?  More broadly, what were the security considerations you had when designing the protocol?','Our early design of Ethernet assumed that security would be taken care of at higher levels of protocol.  Ha! ',0),(33,'BobMetcalfe','How do you feel about Software Defined Networking?  Do you think we will see a trend of moving to centralised control of traditionally distributed algorithms in networking?','SDN is one of the next big things in the Gigafication of the Internet. Control is moving into the network, but I would not say it is being centralized.',0),(34,'BobMetcalfe','Has the Internet exceeded your expectations when you first created it, and if they have, what were your expectations?  Did you think that it would reach the level that it has today?','By far, more each year, who would have guessed?  We were building our own tools, and they escaped to serve uses unimagined, say like YouTube.',0),(35,'BobMetcalfe','Is this your first time on Reddit?','Yes, first time on Reddit.  Its exhausting! ',0),(36,'BobMetcalfe','How do you regard multicasting in networks? )?','Predict that percentage of Internet traffic that is multicast will increase over time as news, entertainment, and information invade.',0),(37,'BobMetcalfe',' This is impossible, right?','No, not impossible, just difficult.  Security should not be implemented at the hardware level.  Higher-level protocols should be relied upon, not cable insulation.',0),(38,'BobMetcalfe',' Which corporate research divisions are shaping the future now?','I think the future of research will be at research universities supported by government agencies, especially NSF.  Universities graduate students, who have proven the most effective innovation vehicles.',0),(39,'BobMetcalfe','How do you feel knowing that you had such a big impact on the whole world ?  Is that fulfilling?','Mostly now I want to share the credit with the hundreds of people who have invented Ethernet over the last 40 years. ',0),(40,'BobMetcalfe','About 15 years ago I used to install Ethernet. Did you use an acronym to remember the color code?','Have long ago forgotten any color codes, sorry, except maybe ROY G BIV. ',0),(41,'BobMetcalfe','What is the craziest thing or product that uses Ethernet?','Everything uses Ethernet, so its hard to pick one. F-16. ',0),(42,'BobMetcalfe','What are some future technologies you are looking forward to?','Detecting, deflecting, capturing, and mining asteroids.  Actually, anything that Elon Musk is doing.',0),(43,'BobMetcalfe','Where did you get the idea from?  What inspired you to create the the Ethernet?','Arpanet (Internet 1.0) packet switching and Alohanet multi-access randomized retransmissions.',0),(44,'BobMetcalfe','  Also, was there something used before Thicknet?','Thick coax was our initial choice because it could be passively tapped. ',0),(45,'davidschwartzmusic','Who had the idea to add the Simon &amp; Garfunkel music in Season 4?','I believe it was Mitch Hurwitz idea.  After all, he is a genius.  I did get to arrange the Mariachi version of Sounds Of Silence.  It was a fairly challenging assignment.  Listen to the Simon &amp; Garfunkel record.  Especially the tempo changes in the first four bars. Classic!',1),(46,'davidschwartzmusic','As a producer thats mostly written dance orientated electronic music, Im very interested in branching out into film scoring and composing. Any advice for someone like me?','There is NO one way.  I got my break by writing a friends movie score that he self financed.  The movie never came out, but one of about 20 people who saw the film was Cheryl Bloch.  Two years later she gave me a chance to try to write something for Northern Exposure.  It became the theme and I got my first scoring job! It was incredibly fortunate as the show was both very popular and very good.  Josh Brand, creator of the show and the other producers were all extremely knowledgable about music and we would use different styles of music for every episode.  This was an incredible learning experience and entrance to a composing career.  One of the best ways to break in, is to work for an established composer, be a great assistant, and try to pick up everything you can while doing the job of helping the composer with whats needed. Also, take any scoring job that you can.  Student films also can be a great starting point. And that student director may turn out to be the next  Ron Howard.  Incidentally, Ron is as nice as you would imagine. ',0),(47,'davidschwartzmusic','A huge tiny mistake?','Love you too! ',0),(48,'davidschwartzmusic','  1) Your music encompasses just about every style, so who would you say are your influences?   2) Do you ever hang out with other TV/film composers, like Post or Zimmer?   3) Aside from bass, did you play any other instruments for AD?  Was that you whistling in the opening theme?   And speaking of the opening theme, (cant believe Im about to link this) how badly did I [butcher your piece? com/watch?','I love your re-orchestration of the theme!  Awesome! My influences are varied.  Like any composer its a total sum of my lifes musical experiences. Early on, as a bassist, I played in almost every style imaginable: Orchestra, jazz combos, rock bands, Glen Miller orchestra (as a sub for two weeks, way after the departure of Glen), country bands, soul bands.  It gave me a lot to draw on as a composer. Although Ive met Mike Post and Hans, unfortunately we dont hang out...yet, im still hoping. Besides bass, I play other instruments as needed.  I try to get other players as much as possible.  Special mention goes to George Doering, guitarist, ukeleleist, and one of the best all around musicians Ive had the pleasure to know.

',0),(49,'davidschwartzmusic','Did you write all of the fictional songs too, eg Getaway, or just the link up/background parts?','Yes, Ive written the great majority of songs for the show. Its something we started with the very first episode. Its pretty unique in television and I have a great time doing it. Gabriel Mann has been a co-writer and singer on many of the songs.  As has been Lucy Schwartz and Larry John McNally.  All great singers.  Interestingly, we usually start and finish the songs in one night, often starting around 10pm, that way I can write score all day and get a boost of energy when we start the song. Theres definitely some songs we wish we couldve made longer versions for, but theres rarely the time.  I usually have a week or less to do score and songs for each episode of Arrested D. ',0),(50,'davidschwartzmusic',' share the song Getaway, full version Getaway, catchy tune Getaway?','I too am hopefully hopeful.  The song should be up on the Netflix blog anytime now.  Gabriel Mann and I will be creating a full length version that will be available on the after mentioned.  ',0),(51,'davidschwartzmusic','How many ukeleles do you own?','You cant have too many ukeleles, but Ive been getting close lately. I have a variety of different ukes  I love my Mya Moe 6 string and resonator uke.  My first uke was a KoAloha and is still a favorite.  The arrested signature uke is actually a tahitian ukelele from Bora Bora and has four double course (strings), all the same gauge fishing wire.   ',0),(52,'davidschwartzmusic','What inspired the ukulele theme?  Was that your composition as well?','Right before we started the original series. I had just returned from a trip to Bora Bora, where I had found a Tahitian Ukulele.  A wonderful Polynesian gentleman who played uke in the hotel bar helped me find one from a luthier friend of his.  Mitch Hurwitz the incredible creator of Arrested D heard the uke on a short cue I did and asked if we could use it for the theme. It was definitely a break through moment and helped define the music for the series. Almost every episode has a old style swing tune composed for that episode. Using the use of ukuleles gives it a unique flavor. ',0),(53,'davidschwartzmusic','Was it your idea to give each characters episode in the new series its own unique flair?','When we started this season, Mitch felt it should be some how different.  Especially since each episode is usually more about a single character.  I think he came up with the idea of adding something for each character.  The woodblock solo performed by jazz great/drummer Peter Erskine, is a personal favorite of mine.',0),(54,'davidschwartzmusic','com/watch? v=h4RKeZJpw1c ) or did it already exist?   If a certain musical cue is used in a situation (as in this example), is it up to you or does the script call for it or how does the process between you and Mitch Hurwitz work?','Yes the arrangement was mine.  Mitch, writer producer Jim Valley, myself and the music editor, Jason Tregoe Newman watch a rough cut of the show and discuss all the spots where we would like to have music.  Theres often a lot of back and forth and a great deal of laughter.  Mitch is funnier in the room than anyone I know.  We also decide what wed like the music to do. A lot of this can change when I actually start the composing process. ',0),(55,'davidschwartzmusic','How do you feel about the Timocil song?','I feel great about it!

It can vary greatly depending on whats going on in post production and air dates. Arrested is very unique in that we dont have a formal review process of music.  Im honored and it also inspires me to write from my first instincts.  Of course we now have a huge library so we have some options for the final dub / show mix.   Also, I like to be on the stage for the final mix if the schedule allows.  This is generally NOT the norm in television.  ',0),(57,'davidschwartzmusic','What is your drink of choice?','If you happen to be at my studio at 4pm, its yogurt shake time! I find if I dont have planned interruptions and breaks, I dont get out of the chair for ten hours.  The 4pm shake break is very popular among my session musicians and assistants.  My scheduled 4pm yogurt-shake break. A favorite among my studio musicians and assistant! It allows me to step back for a minute, take a breath, and see the music in a new light.  Its also very tasty!

Any interesting stories?','I actually have met the cast a few times. They are as funny and as bright as you might imagine.  Interesting fact: Jessica Walters dad was a great bassist and bass teacher in NYC.  As a bassist myself, its something we can bond with. I also worked with Will on  Running Wilde .  I was in NYC visiting the set, Will was there in a smoking jacket and gave me a personal tour of the mansion that they were shooting in. All in all quite surreal. ',0),(59,'davidschwartzmusic',' Was that your intention?  And if it was where do you draw inspiration to write a funnier upbeat style of music?','I may have said this before, but I always try to write music that is fun, as opposed to funny. Its very much about pace and timing. I like to reference feel good music.  Theres a lot of television music from other shows that the music is there to tell you that its funny. Wah-wah-wah waaaaaaah....pizz pizz pizz.... With Arrested, thats not necessary.  Sometimes playing the scene very seriously or over the top mock-drama can be extremely funny.

Interestingly we made that song work in future episodes when the actors spontaneously sing a line of dialog.  Michael sings  Ive just a met a girl today  and Tobias sings  its just a phallusy  twice.

Did it turn out a lot better than you thought? **How was it filming for Training day with Denzel Washington? **What was the best experience you had filming and worst? **Who was one actor/actress your dying to work with, and why?','1) What inspired me to become an actor? I saw Gary Sinise and John Malkovich do Sam Shepherds play TRUE WEST on PBS when I was 13. And I can only describe the feeling as the way I hear people talk about Marlon Brando do STREETCAR; I felt like a door in my brain had been opened.   2) My first big acting gig was EXPLORERS; we have our own spaceship. And I auditioned for it on an absolute lark, and much to my parents dismay, got the part. And did it turn out better than I thought? No... I thought it was going to be one of the greatest films of all time, you know, making ET look like a minor gameshow. And - point in fact - it wasnt out a whole weekend and I went from the envy of my peers to the butt of all their jokes in a very hot second. But in hindsight, I can honestly say that nothing better could have happened to me. A) it prevented me from being a child actor; B) it prepared me for the inevitable failure that comes in a life of the arts and if you cant handle it you have to get out quick.   3) To my mind, Denzel Washington is the greatest movie star of our time. Theres nothing he cant do. And TRAINING DAY is for me like threading a needle; its very difficult to make a hit movie, and its very difficult to make a good movie, and very rarely can you accomplish both at the same time. And Denzel does it over and over again.   4) Best experience has to be the BEFORE series, just because I was involved in the writing of those movies, and they become intensely personal for me. The worst, you never want to talk about because it gets overly quoted on the internet as soon as you say something bad about something or someone, its all anyone wants to talk about. But I spent many lonely months and years in hotel rooms feeling like I was making a piss-poor movie and been depressed about it.   5) Is it okay if I say Leonardo DiCaprio? Because I know hes crazy famous and everyone wants to work with him, but I admire tremendously the way he has handled his celebrity. After the success of TITANIC, it would have been very easy for him to wind up another drug-addled casualty on the Hollywood Strip; but instead hes dedicated himself to making great films and doesnt he need an older brother? Or a bad guy? Isnt there a role for me somewhere?',0),(91,'iamethanhawke','I notice you own an island. Whats the best part of island ownership?','I own an 8 acre island off the coast of Nova Scotia; there are eagles, and seals, and raccoons, and pine trees for days. Believe it or not, land is actually quite affordable up there, and its still rugged and un-gentrified. The people are straightforward and a pleasure to be around; I try to take my kids up there at least once a year. Its a place to disappear in the many times in my life when Ive needed to.',0),(92,'iamethanhawke','Whats the buying process like when shopping for an island?  Did you look at more than one?','Thats a funny question, and deserves to be answered. One does not shop for an island; I have friends in Nova Scotia, and often visited them, one of whom was an older woman who could no longer take care of her island, and she asked if I would buy it. A closet in Manhattan costs more than an island in Nova Scotia. So I answered yes. And Im happy I did. ',0),(93,'iamethanhawke','Here are some unusual questions for you:  1) What kind of music do you listen to?   2) Do you play any instruments?  If so, which ones?   3) Any cool hobbies we show know about?   4) If you could change one thing about your life, what would it be?','1) Well, recently, believe it or not, I went into a huge Elvis Presley hole. After not listening to him my whole life, I took my daughter to Graceland and ended up feeling extremely moved by the plight of poor Mr. Presley. And Ive become obsessed with his music recently. Generally though Connor Oberst is one of the best singer-songwriters, Wilco is one of my favorite bands, and when in doubt, I will put on a Willie Nelson record.  2) I played the guitar since Robert taught me how to play on DEAD POETS SOCIETY but unfortunately Ive never had a lesson since then, so Im not very good.  3) No... Im so lucky, so much of what I would do as a hobby I do for my professional life. I love what I do. And I get to shake it up by directing in a movie, acting in a movie, directing a play, writing a book, acting in a play - ive found a way over the years to continue to shake up my job so it remains interesting to me. Im one of the handful of people who doesnt want a hobby because Id rather be doing my job.  4) I dont want to say. You know, the things that we want to change about our lives are things we dont want everybody to know, and one of the most difficult things for me was having to learn in front of the public that having a reputation is a double-edged sword. It prevents me from making a first impression. I feel like I havent made a first impression on anyone in 20 years. There are many things about my life and my behavior that I wish I could change, situations I wish I could have handled better, relationships I could have healed, but unfortunately the earth seems to turn one way and all we can do is try to learn. ',0),(94,'iamethanhawke','Hey Mr. Hawke,  Any advice for a wannabe scriptwriter in college?','Write every day. Not every other day. Not tomorrow. Not after the party. But before.

Do they just do some sort of interview and casting stuff to make sure the kids are mature enough and realize its all made up?   Is it just not that creepy while actually shooting the creepy stuff?','GREAT question! As a child actor myself, Im incredibly sensitive to this and kind of hate acting with kids for all the same concerns that are present in your question. But with a scary movie, it surprised me, because kids love to play. They love costumes, they love Halloween. The kids on-set treated the making of the movie as if we were all doing an elaborate haunted house; think about it, kids love to play Hide &amp; Seek, they love to scare you and each other, and I was really relieved to see them all playing and laughing and understanding the spirit of a good ghost story. It really wasnt difficult for them at all.',1),(97,'iamethanhawke','What was working with Nick Cage like in Lord of War?','Im kind of obsessed with Nic Cage. I just found out about /r/onetruegod too. Hes the only actor since Marlon Brando thats actually done anything new with the art of acting; hes successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours. If I could erase his bottom half bad movies, and only keep his top half movies, he would blow everyone else out of the water. Hes put a little too much water in his beer, but he is still one of the great actors of our time. And working with him was an absolute pleasure. In fact, one of my favorite scenes Ive ever done is the last scene in LORD OF WAR. ',0),(98,'iamethanhawke','Did you have any inkling that Before Sunrise would turn into a trilogy?    Did you and Julie Delpy have a different approach to your roles in this movie compared to the first two films?     Will there be a fourth?','If you had told me at the wrap party for BEFORE SUNRISE that I would still be talking about this movie 20 years later, I would have thought you were insane. We knew we had a special experience, but I definitely thought it was over. After the second film, I did kind of feel that we had left something unfinished, and thats why Im enjoying the release of BEFORE MIDNIGHT so much - Ive been worrying about it for 9 years.   The approach has been incredibly consistent; the whole way weve worked on the movies has almost been like there was no time in between them at all, in fact they started to feel like one film in my head.    Sometimes I think yes, sometimes I think no - we really wont know until about 5 or 6 years from now. Im sure Rick and Julie and I will get together, and either we will have a shared sense about whats happened to Jesse and Celine, or we wont. I just wont know until then whether were going to feel compelled to make it. Theyre an incredible amount of work, so I know none of us will embark on it if we dont have a good idea.   That film - GATTACA - is made by a man named Andrew Niccol. He wrote THE TRUMAN SHOW, IN TIME, and another movie I did called LORD OF WAR - a lot of people havent seen [LORD OF WAR](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/), but to my mind its a brilliant movie. I have a small part in it, but Nic Cage is phenomenal, and so is the writing.

Its a project also known as THE TWELVE YEAR PROJECT; Richard Linklater and I have made a short film every year for the last 11 years, one more to go, that follows the development of a young boy from age 6 to 18. I play the father, and its Tolstoy-esque in scope. I thought the BEFORE series was the most unique thing I would ever be a part of, but Rick has engaged me in something even more strange. Doing a scene with a young boy at the age of 7 when he talks about why do raccoons die, and at the age of 12 when he talks about video games, and 17 when he asks me about girls, and have it be the same actor - to watch his voice and body morph - its a little bit like timelapse photography of a human being. I cant wait for people to see it.   Next year, he will graduate high school and we will finish the film. It will probably come out in 2 years.   In regards to your compliments on the BEFORE series, I wish you *could* see MIDNIGHT in theatres. Is it money, health or distance that keeps you from going out? Thanks for your support. If you like the first two, I feel pretty confident the third one will be worth your time. ',0),(103,'iamethanhawke','how old will real life Ethan Hawke be when the science of Gattaca is commonplace?','Well, did she like EXPLORERS?   Regarding GATTACA, the scary thing is how prescient its turning out to be, in that its primary statement that seemed radical at the time that we made it was that in the future our identity - our place of work - would be more powerful than our identity to any country. And more and more, I see that happening, where there are a handful of corporations that determine the choices of our life more than our presidents and prime ministers. And then obviously genetic discrimination, which is becoming a wildly interesting subject matter. Id like to recommend Andrew Solomons book [FAR FROM THE TREE](http://www.farfromthetree.com) - its an excellent book on the subject of how our differences are what make us human, and what we perceive as disability is quite often something very different.',0),(104,'iamethanhawke','What was it like working with river Phoenix?','River was one of those people that had that strange magic glow around them; he could drive you crazy, or make you fall in love with him, sometimes in the same minute. I remember knowing he was special when in the first days of filming EXPLORERS - we were staying in a motel outside of San Francisco, and I saw him practicing his characters walk in the parking lot one of the mornings before shooting began. Uncommon behavior for a 13-year old. He had a big, beautiful family, and was the first vegetarian I ever met.

He was intimidating then, and hes intimidating now. What a lot of people dont know about him is that hes a member of the Labyrinth Theater company here in New York, and is a truly phenomenal theatrical director. His production of THE LAST DAYS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT is one of the best evenings in the theatre Ive ever spent.

The guys who made it, the Spierig Brothers, are two young men who are crazy-talented and when we started shooting that movie, TWILIGHT hadnt come out, TRUE BLOOD hadnt come out, I was excited because I thought it was time for a new vampire film. little did I know, but by the time the fx were done, vampires would be passe. We had a hope that DAYBREAKERS would be our MAD MAX to a much better film that could be THE ROAD WARRIOR - because those guys, if ever given a big budget, could really accomplish something major I think. I just worked with them again, in a film called PREDESTINATION - and I have a secret hope that its going to be really special. Its based on a Robert Heinlein short story called  All You Zombies  and it aspires to be the greatest time travel movie ever made.

But the truth is that if I could only make one more movie, and I could make it with anyone in the world, I would really want to make another movie with Richard Linklater. Ever since I saw SLACKER, and DAZED AND CONFUSED, I feel like hes had a very rare and unique voice in movies.

Nothings happening! Shouldnt it at least be funny? Is this boring?  and Rick answered that hed never been in a helicopter crash, hed never been involved in any espionage, hed never been to Outer Space, and yet his life felt full of drama. And the most dramatic thing that ever happened to him was the experience of truly connecting with another person. And he really wanted to try to make a movie about that, about that connection, about that exchange of energy, ideas, and all the dialogue in BEFORE SUNRISE, SUNSET and MIDNIGHT is chasing that connection.

It was such a strange experience to be directed by a man who directed Marlon Brando in his prime, who directed Al Pacino in DOG DAY AFTERNOON, Faye Dunaway in NETWORK...   If youre really interested in his advice, he has a really wonderful book called MAKING MOVIES; I remember I read almost the whole thing on the floor of the Barnes &amp; Noble here in Manhattan when I was about 20 years old. He has a very no-bullshit approach; he talks about making movies almost the way one would talk about building a home. No fanfare, no mystery, just brass tacks. And he pushed Phil Hoffman, Marisa Tomei and I to some of our finest work, and all of us are grateful. And if I had to boil his advice down to one thing, it would be preparation. ',0),(113,'iamethanhawke','Whats your favourite food?','Chips and salsa. I could eat it for every meal.',1),(114,'iamethanhawke','Has anyone ever told you that you look a bit like Gordon Freeman, from the video game Half-Life?','No, they havent, but I just looked at his picture and he looks a little bit creepy. Do I look that creepy? One of the things that sucks about getting older is that you start to look kind of creepy... ',0),(115,'iamethanhawke',' But, my first introduction to you (and Kurt) was through a Slaughterhouse Five audiobook (that is you, right?','I went to a Kurt Vonnegut reading at the 92nd street Y, because I too am a big Vonnegut fan - SLAPSTICK, GALAPAGOS, SIRENS OF TITAN, and BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS being among my favorites. I told him all of this, and a couple weeks later, I got a message from my agent saying Id been requested to do the reading - I dont know if those 2 were connected, but I imagine that they were. Later I heard via the grapevine that he LOVED that reading and it made me really happy. I remember when we met I told him how much I loved SLAPSTICK and he said it wasnt a very good book. ',0),(116,'iamethanhawke','Do you get much time to write in between movies?  And do you write regularly, in one place, have any weird writing habits or lucky charms?','Well, the funny thing is, Ive been working on 3 different projects over the past 10 years writing-wise, and thats why its taken me so long to finish. I have a novel that is almost done, I was worried Id published ASH WEDNESDAY too quickly after THE HOTTEST STATE. I think I was too anxious to prove to myself that I wasnt a dilettante, and I wrote the second book a little too quickly. Ive challenged myself on the third to take more time with it. Four kids have challenged me too. But I will finish my third novel this summer.   Simultaneously, Ive finished a YA book that will come out soon as well. Ive been writing the text for a graphic novel that Greg Ruth will illustrate- he did an amazing book called BORN ON THE BATTLEFIELD.  So Ive been working on these three projects for the past 10 years, and I havent finished any of them! But Im working on it. I try to challenge myself to simply keep a journal, and to write a little bit every day, whether Im making a movie or not making a movie.  That way, when I do have time, when Im not working as an actor, I have material I can draw from and start to work with. ',0),(117,'iamethanhawke','Whats your most memorable moment while filming Dead Poets Society?   What was Robin Williams like on set of that film?','The most memorable scene was the  I sound my barbaric yawp from the rooftops of the world  scene; I had to make up a poem in front of the classroom, and it was the only time I really had to  work  with Robin Williams. And I feel like it was the first time I was ever really challenged to act.   I think Ive already answered what actor I would like to work with - Leo!  - but thank you for your questions.',0),(118,'iamethanhawke','I love scary movies, and Sinister really scared the shit out of me. Were there any parts during filming/when you were watching the final film that you freaked you out or caught you completely off guard?','The thing that really caught me off-guard was how much fun it was to make a scary movie. Id spent my whole career avoiding them, I think because I thought it would be terrifying to do one. But thats like assuming a comedy would be fun to shoot; its not, necessarily. There was a real feeling on the set of SINISTER of that goofy, edgy feeling that you get when a friend tells a story around a campfire late at night and everybody gets the chills. Its just as funny as it is scary. You need a good director to make a scary movie. The difference between a moment being terrifying and a moment being laughably stupid has to do with the music and the cutting; I felt in that film a real beneficiary of Scott Derricksons direction.',0),(119,'iamethanhawke','That was you in Explorers?','It was me and River Phoenix and Jason Presson. ',0),(120,'iamethanhawke','Hey, youre from Austin, TX.

Whats your favorite place to visit?','You know, we set the opening of BEFORE SUNSET in a bookstore in Paris called Shakespeare And Company, and I think that would have to go down as my favorite place to visit. Its right there on the Seine overlooking Notre Dame and has a long history of some of the great minds in literature passing through the doors, and theres a feel there that is unlike any other place Ive ever been. ',0),(123,'iamethanhawke','What is it like to be physically immortal?','You know, thats the greatest myth of acting in movies, is this idea of immortality. In a way, Ive found that my theatre performances age less than my film performances, because they only exist in peoples memories. When someone comes up to me and says I saw you in HURLY BURLY, their face lights up, and I can see the performance is alive in their brain, right there, and it also means that one day we were in the same room together, we had a shared experience. They might say, it was Christmas night, it was snowing, it started 25 minutes late, and Ill say  I remember  and that evening is very much alive for the both of us. Whereas when I show EXPLORERS to my children, its obvious to me that film is aging. ',0),(124,'iamethanhawke','  What has been your favorite acting experience so far?  When will we get a chance to see Before Midnight here?','Well, thank you, and I think one of my favorite acting experiences is something unfortunately in Denver you woudnt have been able to see, but I did a new Sir Tom Stoppard play called THE COAST OF UTOPIA - that we only performed in its entirety a handful of times as its 12 hours long (with several intermissions). We would start performances at 11 AM, and we would do our curtain call at 11 PM. There was a lunch break and a dinner break, obviously, but it was about the mid-19th century Russian radicals; you could read it, but Stoppard is one of the few no-nonsense geniuses Ive met in my life, and it was a pleasure to be in the rehearsal room for 9 months. If you read it, I played Mikhail Bakunin and Billy Crudup played Belinsky.',0),(125,'iamethanhawke',' Since there were three people who had their hand in writing the screenplay for Before Midnight, does that mean you all had equal influence over what the characters said and did, or did you and Delpy get to have creative influence only with respect to your own characters?','I imagine that it would be easy to think that Julie writes her dialogue and I write mine; the truth is that the three of us, Richard, Julie and myself, sit in a room for somewhere around 10-12 weeks and talk about Jesse and Celine. We talk about where they might be developmentally, and Julie has helped construct Jesse as much as Ive helped construct Celine, and Richard is a big part of both those characters as well. In the first one, we largely wrote our own dialogue, because there was a pre-existing script, but in the second and third, the three of us, from outline-forward, were a part of every line.',0),(126,'iamethanhawke','Which was the freakiest scene of The Purge to shoot?','The whole movie was freaky. The concept is freaky. Every day of the shoot was kind of intense and surreal. Hard for me to pinpoint, but the actor who plays the main villain - Rhys Wakefield - his performance seemed like he was channeling Satan himself. So I would have to say anytime I acted with him. ',0),(127,'iamethanhawke',' What was it like to do a Marathon of plays (with such heavy dialogue?','Well, I wish you remembered that I was in all 3 plays, it makes me somehow feel that I did a poor job in one of them... As I mentioned before, it was definitely the highlight of a 20 year acting career, and the fact that you were there fills me with admiration for YOU because hard as it was to perform them all day, I cant imagine having the power of concentration to WATCH them all day. It was the one time in my life I came out for a curtain call when I wanted to applaud the audience.',0),(128,'iamethanhawke',' Did you enjoy making that movie?','I know youre supposed to say this kind of thing, but its one of my favorite films that Ive done. I know that audiences have always loved TRAINING DAY, but in many ways, BROOKLYNS FINEST is the East coast sequel. Antoine Fuqua (who directed both films) has a real special feel for capturing the street. And both Jake (from TRAINING DAY) and Sal (from BROOKLYNS FINEST) are two of my favorite characters that Ive gotten to play; one the good guy, one the bad guy. ',0),(129,'iamethanhawke',' Any new novels coming our way?  Have you considered updating us on these characters?','Yes, I have a third novel that is at the publishers office now and this summer, I am going to dedicate a couple months to proofreading it and getting it ready for you to read. I dont know if Im going to be revisiting the same characters, but Im definitely revisiting the same themes.',0),(130,'realhanszimmer',' **What was your inspiration for this piece?  Or tell me something about your experience creating this piece? **  - Of all of your work on film, what is your most favorite composition that you wrote, and why is it your favorite?   - What can we expect from the music in Man of Steel?','For  This Land  - the whole *Lion King* soundtrack is really me dealing with my fathers death, which up to that point I had never really done, because children suppress things, and I was rather surprised that, in a cartoon with fuzzy animals, I was suddenly confronted with my past. The other thing is, because I wrote it for my daughter, it connected the generations over time through music.   My favorite composition that I wrote...I find fault with all of it, nothing is ever finished, thats why I carry on writing, and part of what I like is influenced by the people I am working with. So some of my favorites have more to do with process than the actual end result. So a Zack Snyder or a Chris Nolan seem to bring out some pretty good things in me.  For *Man of Steel* you can expect hope. Hope and no cynicism. The opposite of *The Dark Knight.* Trying to celebrate hard-working, simple, blue-collar people in the Midwest who never get celebrated. ',0),(131,'realhanszimmer',' How has your personal involvement with any of the series/concepts youve scored affected your work on that project?  For example, are you a really big fan of any character/idea you happened to compose for?  What sort of music do you like to listen to in your free time?  Whats one unexpected place youve found inspiration for some of your work?','1.) You have to fall in love with the characters, and at the same time, you always have to put a part of yourself into the character. I grew up with comic books, so I am a huge Superman fan, so that actually became very daunting because I didnt want to ruin one of my favorite characters for a whole generation. It was interesting working on *Thelma and Louise* and having to try to find a female voice or point of view in me.  2.) Anything from LCD Soundsystem to film scores - Im a soundtrack nerd- to the music of my people, Kraftwerk.  3.) Unexpected place? One of the great guilty pleasures of working on movies is that you get to go to places that other people sometimes cant go to, so being alone at the Louvre at night, in front of the Mona Lisa for *The Da Vinci Code* made that one worthwhile.   4.) The sounds I hear in my head, my head is quite a good instrument.  Thank you, thank you- what else can you say to that? Thank you for the compliment.',0),(132,'realhanszimmer','Hans, do you ever get goose bumps listening to your own music?','Thats a great question - its actually more breaking out in sweat of fear of other people hating it.  But no, I cant listen to my own stuff without being critical all the time.',1),(133,'realhanszimmer','  Is this rumor true?   What would you to say to composers who criticize your compositions for being too simple?','1.) An intern started this and I never wanted to hurt their feelings but it tasted disgusting. Maybe now I can finally tell them the truth. Just a little spoonful.   2.) Ive spent my life trying to make things simpler. Because I find ultimately that complicated doesnt reach the heart. ',0),(134,'realhanszimmer','  My question is firstly whether or not film scoring should be pursued professionally, or is it better to pursue some other aspect in music, while learning film scoring as a side aspect, or if I enjoy it then should I pursue it professionally?  Is it easy to establish a firm ground in the industry of film scoring?    How does the creativity come about?  How do you manage so many instruments, producing the sound you want?','It is impossible to establish a firm ground in the industry of film scoring. I still feel petrified that I live and die by whatever my last piece of music is. I like film scoring because I love stories, and its my way of telling a story. I get my music from the stories and from looking at the images, so I think if you want to become a good film scorer, look at books, look at paintings.   In regards to managing so many instruments, with the help of a good conductor. But Im a synthesizer geek, so I like making my own sounds, and I can get lost for days trying to make the perfect bass sound. I have heard that a photo of my studio by Trey Radcliffe has been very popular on reddit in the past; I actually assembled my collection of Moog synthesizers when everybody was embracing digital and throwing out the old analog stuff. God, were they wrong. The thing that pins you to your seat in *Dark Knight* or *Man of Steel* is Professor Moogs 40-year-old invention.',0),(135,'realhanszimmer','Whats your studio setup like?','I found the post! [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/yp3w7/just_a_photo_of_hans_zimmers_studio_i_expected/) is my humble little den. If you have to spend 98% of your life in a room without windows, you might as well have some fun with a decor. It was modeled on the interior of a turn-of-the-century Viennese brothel. But dont call me a musical whore.',0),(136,'realhanszimmer','Speaking of simple songs, do you listen to a lot of popular music?  What is your favorite current pop song?','I am a YouTube junkie. Yes, really. I find you can discover incredible musicians all the time. I listen to anything; in the words of Duke Ellington, there are only 2 types of music, good and bad. Im working on my psychedelic, country-western heavy metal album.',1),(137,'realhanszimmer','If you would had the chance to score for one movie which has already been released, which would it be?','Blade Runner.

As for the more serious question, which of the upcoming project areyou the most excited about?  Can you spill some beans?','Regarding epic - I dont know why my music is so epic, its just how I hear things in my head. I use very simple devices and tunes. Its usually not the size of the orchestra or the production that makes things sound epic, its usually the commitment of the players. A great string quartet can sound louder when they play with fire and heart, than a boring orchestra, and a single note by Jeff Beck can slice right through your heart.  For upcoming projects, I am really excited about *Rush*, which was just really fun to work on, and I think that its the first race car movie that really got it right. And I was honored working with Steve McQueen on *12 Years A Slave,* which is a phenomenal, daring movie with a story that needed to be told. And Im starting to have a little fun with Chris Nolan on his next project, *Interstellar.*',0),(139,'realhanszimmer',' Like whats your go to DAW?  What are your go to plugins?  Do you use many virtual instruments or mainly track real instruments?   Any other recording/tracking tips and tricks youd like to share?','I use Cubase; all the UAD plugins; and Zebra, which is to me the greatest software synth ever built. We build a lot of our own technology at RCP, so our sampler and touchscreens are custom-built. One of my greatest ambitions is to keep orchestral music alive, so I try to use as many live musicians as I possibly can. For example, I just had the honor of employing 15 of the greatest drummers in the world for *Man of Steel* and using 8 pedal-steel players at the same time. I think it was a world first.   For tips, Id say write a good piece... I spend forever getting the arrangement right. Find the best musicians you can, and leave it up to a really good recording engineer. ',0),(140,'realhanszimmer','  As for a question, if you could compose a theme for any person - historical, alive, dead, fictional, real - who would it be?   And since you mentioned you love truth or dare, what is the best dare you can come up with on the spot?','If I could compose a theme for any person - I love Elgars Enigma Variations, where he wrote a set of symphonic pieces, each one depicting one of his friends, including a dog. I always loved that idea. I would write about the people I love, except I dont ever seem to have the time to write anything! But one day Ill get around to it.   Best dare I can come up with on the spot - for me, it was such a dare to even tackle *Man of Steel* because i didnt want to ruin it for a whole generation! I grew up with loving the John Williams score to *Superman* and the greatest dare is always to get over my own paranoia, neuroses, and all other insecurities a composer suffers every moment of the day. Its a little bit like standing naked on a cold day on the beach in front of the most beautiful girl.',0),(141,'realhanszimmer',' Can you talk a little bit more about the piece?  Do you use music to cope?','I found out about the Aurora shooting in the middle of an interview, and the journalist asked me to comment, and all I could come up with were the word  devastated and shocked.  And I suddenly realized that my language was music. And I wanted to write a piece of music that would show the people in Aurora that the whole world was there with them. It was the only response I could have, to put beauty against violence, and that we are all alone in this together.   I wanted the music to bring everybody together. Because you can only set art against violence. Nothing else seems to have worked so far.    I want to continue to create art that makes people think, and talk to each other. Use your words, not your guns. ',0),(142,'realhanszimmer','Which composition of yours took the longest to complete?','Notes per minute? Probably the Clark Kent theme from *Man of Steel* because I was procrastinating for so long, trying to shake off the enormous shadow that John Williams *Superman* theme cast.',0),(143,'realhanszimmer','Have you ever thought of making music for video games?','I did do *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.* I think that videogames are going to become the movies of the future; its a very different way of writing.

I will absolutely score more games in the future.',1),(144,'realhanszimmer','Dear Mr. Zimmer,  If there was one composer from any point in history that you could go back and meet, who would it be and why?','Beethoven, because those first 4 notes of the Fifth are so simple and how did he know that he could create such magic with them?',0),(145,'realhanszimmer','jpg), anything planned for Nintendo ?

Whats the relation?','I just tweak around until it sounds good to me. It never sounds as good as it sounds when I first think of it, so a lot of fiddling with synthesizers goes on to get it a little closer to my first sonic vision. The live orchestra gives it an energy and a humanity that you just cant get out of the electronics, so trying to strike a balance. All musical instruments are technological devices; it doesnt matter if its electronic or if its made from a tree with bits of dead cat attached.

So far, Im glad to be here!',0),(148,'realhanszimmer','Dear Mr. Zimmer,   Of Nolans Batman films, which was your favorite to score?','The third, because it brought everything together - after all, it was nine years of our lives, and I think we became a very good family in that time.

But curiously, very often its the cinematography and the light that inform my colors that I will use in my music. So I try to always make a point to talk to the DP.  2) Dont take no for an answer.

',0),(155,'realhanszimmer','  I am curious, **who are some of the composers and works who most influenced you, and is there anyone relatively new in the score world who has impressed you?','Its very simple - I find if you want a well-rounded musical education, just listen to composers whose names begin with  B.  Bach, Beethoven, Beatles, BB King, Burt Bacharach, Berlioz... But not Bruckner. Its always amazing that my simplistic music seems to touch complete strangers, and somehow we have a connection and a conversation through that music.

Do you think that everything we hear can be music, or does music have to follow a standard or lets say have a minimum of criteria to be officially called  music , in which case, what are those criteria?   And do you think people who learn music later on, like after the age of 20, can still become musicians or is there a specific age you need to learn music at in order to be a true musician?','I think organized noise becomes music; I try to be appropriate to the story that we are trying to tell, but I try to find new ways of telling it. There have been many Sherlock Holmes movies before I started writing for it, and it was just my way of finding a new take, but I think its true to the intellectual curiosity that Conan Doyle gave his character. ',0),(158,'realhanszimmer',' Do you ever consider or think about how people listen to your music when you compose or are you 100% going for the feeling of the movie?','When I write the score, I only think about the characters and the story, but when I try to put the soundtrack album together, I try to actually make it a good listening experience. I actually work very hard to try to be responsible at delivering a decent soundtrack album, and not just make it an afterthought to the movie. I try to write music that can stand on its own two feet, apart from the picture.',0),(159,'realhanszimmer',' but what the process in making Time?

In a movie I can always be specific about the character. Glad to hear you enjoy the music, thank you!',0),(161,'realhanszimmer',' Do you agree with this assessment, or do you have another personal favorite?','Im far too close to it to judge.

',0),(176,'thealtonbrown','Hi Alton, long time fan here, thank you very much for doing this AMA. Is there anything youve touted on Good Eats as a  golden rule  that you have changed your opinion on?','Yes.  I really messed up with cooking pasta in season 1.  I said to bring a gallon of water to a boil before cooking dry pasta.  Crap!  Start in cold water and only use enough to cover the pasta.  ',1),(177,'thealtonbrown','Hi Alton! What is the one food that Food Network would not let you make an episode of Good Eats about, that you wanted to do the most?','Food Network has always been very supportive of me and theyve let me get away with a lot but when I said  sweetbreads  they said  no.   Same with rabbit. ',0),(178,'thealtonbrown','  How much do we have to bug you two now to make this a thing?','Mr. Bourdain doesnt need a sidekick. ',0),(179,'thealtonbrown','What did you think about going to the strip club with Anthony Bourdain?','If I had a time machine....I would so take that one back.  Ive never been more uncomfortable in my life. ',0),(180,'thealtonbrown','Alton, I make my soft pretzels with lye, on your show you said you can use baking soda.

My fiancee has zero interest in food beyond eating it (I blame her familys boxed meal habits) and I love to cook (thanks to Good Eats) and try new things, any advice to get her to be more adventurous?','Look...just go ahead and dump her before its too late.  Shes clearly damaged. ',0),(183,'thealtonbrown','Is there anyone within the Food Network confines that you could not/cannot stand?','Hell yes. ',0),(184,'thealtonbrown','What correctable mistakes do you think most home cooks unknowingly commit?','I think that a lot of home cooks miscalculate heat.  We seem to be a bit afraid of it but must master it to be true cooks.  Heat is elemental to the process',0),(185,'thealtonbrown','  How did it feel when they finally recanted?     Also, what is your favorite dish that you normally make for dinner?','Well, its not like I actually had anything to do with that.  I think the whole thing was good for bourbon drinkers because it opened a lot of eyes to the fact that there are a lot of great bourbons out there.  ',0),(186,'thealtonbrown','  Ill jump right into this non-food question, is it true you carry a 1911?','Actually a 1911 is a little heavy for every day carry unless its a Browning 9 hi-power which is essentially a 1911.  I carry a Kimber Solo a fair bit.

Im pretty sure that learning to use fire gave us the ability to seriously up our dietary game and made us what we are...apex predators on planet Earth. ',0),(189,'thealtonbrown',' Any plans to post some of the stuff again?','Im flattered that you remember that old stuff.  Regrettably, I lost all of it when we took down the old site.  Im not very good at keeping up with that kind of thing. ',0),(190,'thealtonbrown','Thanks for the AMA! Simple question from me:  What is your favorite thing to grill?','Skirt steak...directly on the coals.  No grate. Just salt and a wee bit of oil.

',0),(192,'thealtonbrown','   I have two questions: What drove you into the culinary world?  What was your favorite homemade meal growing up?','My favorite homemade meal was my moms spaghetti.  I was driven into food because its the universal subject...everyone loves food.  Its what connects all of us to each other. ',0),(193,'thealtonbrown','  My question for you is how did you lose your accent for television?   How difficult of a process was it?','To be honest, my family is from GA but I was born in Los Angeles and lived there until I was 8.  So, Ive always sounded like I came out of a television.

Simple as that. ',0),(198,'thealtonbrown','Who is W on the show?','A wonderful actress name of Vickie Wong.  She disliked me from the very first audition...thats why she was so perfect. ',0),(199,'thealtonbrown','  Is this just the nature of the recipe or are there any tips for helping it firm up a bit more?','It sounds like you might be pulling it a little underdone.  Add 5 more minutes to the cooking, or turn off the oven and leave it for another 10. And make sure its thoroughly chilled before cutting. ',0),(200,'thealtonbrown','If you had to pick only one episode of Good Eats to show someone, which would it be?','Probably our very last episode  Turn On The Dark  which was a one hour chocolate special.  We pulled out all the stops on that one. ',0),(201,'thealtonbrown',' Whats it gonna be?','Duck confit because it takes 3 days to make. ',0),(202,'thealtonbrown','Please bring your tour to Canada! Please?','Okay, okay...I will. ',0),(203,'thealtonbrown',' Q&gt; Are you ever going to do another set of shows involving riding and travel?','I would love to do more travel-related shows.  The problem is,  Feasting  never found enough audience to keep it on the air.  Maybe on-line would be different though. ',0),(204,'thealtonbrown','Do you ever watch Archer?  Do you keep in contact with Lucky Yates?','I was hugging Lucky Yates about 30 minutes ago.  Im a huge fan. Hes a great guy...also a very talented puppeteer.

',0),(206,'thealtonbrown','Is there any good way to cook a steak on a gas grill?','Yes.  Make sure the steak is out of the fridge for at least an hour before you cook it.  And liberally season with kosher salt AN HOUR BEFORE COOKING.  Trust me. ',0),(207,'thealtonbrown','Do you geek out about food at home?  Is your wife also a food geek?','My wife geeks out over steak and potatoes.  ',0),(208,'thealtonbrown','   What is your favorite dish to cook when you are short on time?

INSERT INTO `qadatatop25yr` VALUES (1,'BobMetcalfe',' I want to ask you one of our final exam questions: What would happen if all of the Internet was simply an Ethernet with switches, and MAC addresses were used instead of IP addresses?  And one more question: do you think more efficient multiple access protocols can/will be invented in the future?','Have heard from those still in the packet plumbing industry that the trend is back from Internet routing toward Ethernet switching.  Have no dog in that hunt.  Ethernet was first designed to be LAN packet plumbing for the Internet.  Have been predicting for years that TCP/IP/Ethernet would be replaced by some version of lambda switching, but that has not happened and Im not sure what that means anyway.  The trend was away from multi-access for a while, with the reemergence of wiring hubs, but then along came WiFi and LTE.  ',0),(2,'BobMetcalfe','What was your protocol review / update process?  How did you know which layers would change, especially when considering industrial production lines of different CPUs?    How can we use a similar approach to incorporate future network variables?','The layering of Internet protocols is its greatest invention.  Layering has allowed me to live a rich full life at layers 1 and 2 while a bunch of other people got to play above me without permission.  All that serendipity.  Ethernet and TCP/IP were invented in 1973 in Palo Alto, where I am this second, and the World Wide Web was not invented until 1989 and the plumbing still worked.  Whoa, dude! ',0),(3,'BobMetcalfe','What are your thoughts on Google Fiber (as its coming to Austin soon)?  And what, exactly, sparked your interest in communications?','Google Fiber is great news for everyone, especially as a spur to AT&amp;T and Comcast and Time Warner et al.  Competition!  We are now gigafying the Internet -- build it and they (new apps) will come, so far anyway.  Got interested in communications because thats what ARPA was funding the year I started grad school in 1969. ',0),(4,'BobMetcalfe','High, im sitting in class browsing reddit thanks to you, how do you feel your invention has impacted the younger generation?','Close your PC and pay attention to the professor.  And do not get me started on ageism with this  younger generation  stuff.  Anyway, we used to have a lot of electronics in our dorm rooms at college back in the 1960s, but those were stereo systems.',0),(5,'BobMetcalfe','Thank you for doing this AMA! What are your thoughts on the future of Internet privacy and government control of information?','Trust governments to invade your privacy.  We must use tools to keep our stuff a secret.  Am not expert on this, but I do mail all my financial secrets to the IRS through the USPS every April 15th trusting that no USPS union member or IRS agent will peek. Oy.',0),(6,'BobMetcalfe','Was token ring a better technology than Ethernet back in the day when both were in use?','No.  Even though our beloved IEEE 802 standardized IBM Token Ring, having sold it myself, I can say it was never really open (had SNA dust all over it), and it was slow and expensive compared to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet.  IBM never really got how to be an open standard during the LAN Wars. ',0),(7,'BobMetcalfe','Do you think someone else could have done it at the time?','Yes, but they didnt.  I was lucky to be born to my parents, to accidentally get accepted to MIT, to sneak into Xerox Parc, and lucky to get the completely new problem of having a building full of personal computers, one on every desk, if you can imagine.',0),(8,'BobMetcalfe','What do you think of Google?','Wish I had thought of that.  As a professor of innovation, I like Google especially because of its  pivot  from fast search to auctioned targeted advertising.  Google unseated Microsoft which unseated IBM.  Who will unseat Google?  Cannot wait to see how that plays out.',0),(9,'BobMetcalfe','Hey bob my question is looking back on how much the internet has progressed over the years did you have a different purpose for it?','The Internet intelligentsia from the 1970s are outraged at the newbies who have dared to use the Internet for purposes completely unintended, like advertising, like YouTube.  Tough.  I cannot wait to see the next big new applications enabled by the Gigabit Internet.  Connectivity is good.',0),(10,'BobMetcalfe','Hi Bob, can you to speak to new markets that Ethernet will be expanding to?','Ethernet is going up, into, over, across, and down into new markets.  Up toward terabit LAN.  Into the WAN killing SONET.  Over the airwaves as WiFi.  Across the telechasm, between carrier WANs and customer LANs, as Carrier Ethernet.  And won into embedded networking, as ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4).',0),(11,'BobMetcalfe','How badass does it make you feel to be able to honestly say  I invented Ethernet ?','For some values of I, invented, and Ethernet, I can honestly say that I invented Ethernet.  But so can a lot of other people.  Proud, yes.  Also, wildly curious about where this monster goes next.',0),(12,'BobMetcalfe',' I meant to ask you this but I never got the chance, out of all of the careers youve had so far, which has been your favorite and most rewarding?','Five careers, not counting 23 years as a student: engineer-scientist, entrepreneur-executive (when my company grew too big), publisher-pundit, venture capitalist, not professor of innovation.  Favorite?  All so different, they defy comparison.  Just another 7.5 years to next career.',0),(13,'BobMetcalfe',' before hand it was never even thought of?','The terminal on my desk at Xerox Parc was communicating at 300bps the day before we installed an Alto PC and CSMA/CD Ethernet running at 2.94Mbps, which is about 10,000 times faster.  We went that fast because we could, and because our new laser printer could consume 20Mbps.',0),(14,'BobMetcalfe','You invented a product which is used extensively around the world and yet many people (me included) had no idea who you were (sorry). Do you find this annoying?','Am quite famous among my people, networking nerds.  Thats enough for me.  On the other hand, who is Katy Perry?',0),(15,'BobMetcalfe','What is the best/biggest thing youve done or witnessed as a Member of the MIT Corporation?','Attending MIT trustee meetings is the most fun you can have standing up.  Recent excitement was the debut of the MOOC edX, which is going to help the Internet disrupt education the way that iTunes disrupted music and Amazon disrupted books, or BOOCs as I call them.',0),(16,'BobMetcalfe','What do you think separates intellectual innovators from the rest of the population, for example, Mark with Facebook?  What prompts the mind to such great ideas , or new innovations?  In other words, what advice would you have for an undergrad that wants to make things that literally change the world?','Innovations depend much on context, and so it helps to be at the right place at the right time, as Zuckerberg is.  But then you have to be skilled enough and ambitious enough to act, as Zuckerberg has.',0),(17,'BobMetcalfe','What are your feelings towards Bill Gates?','Great man.  It would be very hard to find someone else better at being the richest man on Earth.  Bill may not like me for going after Microsoft for its anti-competitive practices during the 1990s, but I meant no harm.',0),(18,'BobMetcalfe','Have you ever worked with Sir Tim Berners-Lee?','Sir Tim holds the 3Com Founders Chair at MIT, where I am a Life Trustee, so I bump into Sir Tim now and then, like at SXSW when he came to Austin.  He is like Gandhi with ADD.',0),(19,'BobMetcalfe','Did you make a lot of money off the invention?','Did not make my Ethernet money on patent royalties, but by SELLING Ethernet for a decade to people who didnt know they needed it. ',0),(20,'BobMetcalfe','What is your preferred color of Ethernet cable?   A sweet royal blue?   Canary yellow?','Yellow is the official Ethernet cable color, in my mind.  I wonder if IEEE has a spec on that.',0),(21,'BobMetcalfe','How do you feel about Software Defined Networking?  Do you think we will see a trend of moving to centralised control of traditionally distributed algorithms in networking?','SDN is one of the next big things in the Gigafication of the Internet. Control is moving into the network, but I would not say it is being centralized.',0),(22,'BobMetcalfe','How do you deal with challenging people or situations?  What is the best advice someone told you?','God (or Darwin) gave us one mouth and two ears.  Take the hint.  Best to listen first.  Summarize back with the language youve heard.  Then, act!',0),(23,'BobMetcalfe','Wish more people understood just how versatile ethernet is. What are your thoughts on FCoE vs iSCSI when transmitting data for storage products?','Ethernet vs Ethernot usually ends up Ethernet.  The Network Effect (as quantified by Metcalfes Law) plus all the Ethernet infrastructure that has accumulated over 40 years.  Remember, RS232C circa 1962 is still out there.',0),(24,'BobMetcalfe','What do you think the most positive impact the internet has had on society as a whole?','The Internet reduces market frictions and expands freedom of choice.  I give the Internet credit for everything good that has happened since 1969. ',0),(25,'BobMetcalfe','Do you get royalties on your invention?','I made a play to get a buck per Ethernet node, but had to settle for a penny per packet.',0),(26,'BobMetcalfe','Do you think the claims that the internet reduces actual communication and devalues some of the things that used to define society are valid?','No.  But I think the theres good stuff on TV, more good stuff than before, despite all the crap.  Good thing we have search.',0),(27,'BobMetcalfe',' This is impossible, right?','No, not impossible, just difficult.  Security should not be implemented at the hardware level.  Higher-level protocols should be relied upon, not cable insulation.',0),(28,'BobMetcalfe','if you are confident you wont have to eat your words, any new predictions?','Better to eat my words than someone elses.  I make 10 predictions per day.  My batting average is above .500.  Yall of course remember the big ones I got wrong.',0),(29,'BobMetcalfe','Has the Internet exceeded your expectations when you first created it, and if they have, what were your expectations?  Did you think that it would reach the level that it has today?','By far, more each year, who would have guessed?  We were building our own tools, and they escaped to serve uses unimagined, say like YouTube.',0),(30,'BobMetcalfe','Why didnt you make it so that the packet preamble couldnt be reproduced in the packet payload?  More broadly, what were the security considerations you had when designing the protocol?','Our early design of Ethernet assumed that security would be taken care of at higher levels of protocol.  Ha! ',0),(31,'BobMetcalfe','When the internet first became a thing, did you think porn would have such a huge part of it?','What  Porn on the Internet?  Ethernet filters out porn.',0),(32,'BobMetcalfe','How do you feel knowing that you had such a big impact on the whole world ?  Is that fulfilling?','Mostly now I want to share the credit with the hundreds of people who have invented Ethernet over the last 40 years. ',0),(33,'BobMetcalfe','How do you regard multicasting in networks? )?','Predict that percentage of Internet traffic that is multicast will increase over time as news, entertainment, and information invade.',0),(34,'BobMetcalfe','How do I send data into the future?','Just leave data lying around, and it will get to the future automatically. ',0),(35,'BobMetcalfe','What is your biggest pet peeve?','That nobody ever changes their mind. ',0),(36,'BobMetcalfe','What are your views on American government trying to censor and control the way people use the internet?','Governments should leave the Internet alone. ',0),(37,'BobMetcalfe','About 15 years ago I used to install Ethernet. Did you use an acronym to remember the color code?','Have long ago forgotten any color codes, sorry, except maybe ROY G BIV. ',0),(38,'BobMetcalfe','What are some future technologies you are looking forward to?','Detecting, deflecting, capturing, and mining asteroids.  Actually, anything that Elon Musk is doing.',0),(39,'BobMetcalfe','Is this your first time on Reddit?','Yes, first time on Reddit.  Its exhausting! ',0),(40,'BobMetcalfe','What is the craziest thing or product that uses Ethernet?','Everything uses Ethernet, so its hard to pick one. F-16. ',0),(41,'BobMetcalfe','  Also, was there something used before Thicknet?','Thick coax was our initial choice because it could be passively tapped. ',0),(42,'BobMetcalfe','Where did you get the idea from?  What inspired you to create the the Ethernet?','Arpanet (Internet 1.0) packet switching and Alohanet multi-access randomized retransmissions.',0),(43,'davidschwartzmusic','As a producer thats mostly written dance orientated electronic music, Im very interested in branching out into film scoring and composing. Any advice for someone like me?','There is NO one way.  I got my break by writing a friends movie score that he self financed.  The movie never came out, but one of about 20 people who saw the film was Cheryl Bloch.  Two years later she gave me a chance to try to write something for Northern Exposure.  It became the theme and I got my first scoring job! It was incredibly fortunate as the show was both very popular and very good.  Josh Brand, creator of the show and the other producers were all extremely knowledgable about music and we would use different styles of music for every episode.  This was an incredible learning experience and entrance to a composing career.  One of the best ways to break in, is to work for an established composer, be a great assistant, and try to pick up everything you can while doing the job of helping the composer with whats needed. Also, take any scoring job that you can.  Student films also can be a great starting point. And that student director may turn out to be the next  Ron Howard.  Incidentally, Ron is as nice as you would imagine. ',0),(44,'davidschwartzmusic','Did you write all of the fictional songs too, eg Getaway, or just the link up/background parts?','Yes, Ive written the great majority of songs for the show. Its something we started with the very first episode. Its pretty unique in television and I have a great time doing it. Gabriel Mann has been a co-writer and singer on many of the songs.  As has been Lucy Schwartz and Larry John McNally.  All great singers.  Interestingly, we usually start and finish the songs in one night, often starting around 10pm, that way I can write score all day and get a boost of energy when we start the song. Theres definitely some songs we wish we couldve made longer versions for, but theres rarely the time.  I usually have a week or less to do score and songs for each episode of Arrested D. ',0),(45,'davidschwartzmusic','  1) Your music encompasses just about every style, so who would you say are your influences?   2) Do you ever hang out with other TV/film composers, like Post or Zimmer?   3) Aside from bass, did you play any other instruments for AD?  Was that you whistling in the opening theme?   And speaking of the opening theme, (cant believe Im about to link this) how badly did I [butcher your piece? com/watch?','I love your re-orchestration of the theme!  Awesome! My influences are varied.  Like any composer its a total sum of my lifes musical experiences. Early on, as a bassist, I played in almost every style imaginable: Orchestra, jazz combos, rock bands, Glen Miller orchestra (as a sub for two weeks, way after the departure of Glen), country bands, soul bands.  It gave me a lot to draw on as a composer. Although Ive met Mike Post and Hans, unfortunately we dont hang out.yet, im still hoping. Besides bass, I play other instruments as needed.  I try to get other players as much as possible.  Special mention goes to George Doering, guitarist, ukeleleist, and one of the best all around musicians Ive had the pleasure to know. Also a great guy! The superb whistling is my good friend and musician James McVay. He calls his style, Merry Milkman. ',0),(46,'davidschwartzmusic','What inspired the ukulele theme?  Was that your composition as well?','Right before we started the original series. I had just returned from a trip to Bora Bora, where I had found a Tahitian Ukulele.  A wonderful Polynesian gentleman who played uke in the hotel bar helped me find one from a luthier friend of his.  Mitch Hurwitz the incredible creator of Arrested D heard the uke on a short cue I did and asked if we could use it for the theme. It was definitely a break through moment and helped define the music for the series. Almost every episode has a old style swing tune composed for that episode. Using the use of ukuleles gives it a unique flavor. ',0),(47,'davidschwartzmusic','Who had the idea to add the Simon &amp; Garfunkel music in Season 4?','I believe it was Mitch Hurwitz idea.  After all, he is a genius.  I did get to arrange the Mariachi version of Sounds Of Silence.  It was a fairly challenging assignment.  Listen to the Simon &amp; Garfunkel record.  Especially the tempo changes in the first four bars. Classic!',0),(48,'davidschwartzmusic','What is your drink of choice?','If you happen to be at my studio at 4pm, its yogurt shake time! I find if I dont have planned interruptions and breaks, I dont get out of the chair for ten hours.  The 4pm shake break is very popular among my session musicians and assistants.  My scheduled 4pm yogurt-shake break. A favorite among my studio musicians and assistant! It allows me to step back for a minute, take a breath, and see the music in a new light.  Its also very tasty!

If a certain musical cue is used in a situation (as in this example), is it up to you or does the script call for it or how does the process between you and Mitch Hurwitz work?','Yes the arrangement was mine.  Mitch, writer producer Jim Valley, myself and the music editor, Jason Tregoe Newman watch a rough cut of the show and discuss all the spots where we would like to have music.  Theres often a lot of back and forth and a great deal of laughter.  Mitch is funnier in the room than anyone I know.  We also decide what wed like the music to do. A lot of this can change when I actually start the composing process. ',0),(50,'davidschwartzmusic','  * How long does it take to get the end product for the show, from start to finish and how long does the studio give you to complete it?  * Also I am very interested to know what the studio tells you when they request a piece, do they give you any guidelines as what it should sound like or mood it should evoke in the listener?','Turnaround is often less than a week.  It can vary greatly depending on whats going on in post production and air dates. Arrested is very unique in that we dont have a formal review process of music.  Im honored and it also inspires me to write from my first instincts.  Of course we now have a huge library so we have some options for the final dub / show mix.   Also, I like to be on the stage for the final mix if the schedule allows.  This is generally NOT the norm in television.  ',0),(51,'davidschwartzmusic','How many ukeleles do you own?','You cant have too many ukeleles, but Ive been getting close lately. I have a variety of different ukes  I love my Mya Moe 6 string and resonator uke.  My first uke was a KoAloha and is still a favorite.  The arrested signature uke is actually a tahitian ukelele from Bora Bora and has four double course (strings), all the same gauge fishing wire.   ',0),(52,'davidschwartzmusic','Do you get to meet the cast a lot?  Any interesting stories?','I actually have met the cast a few times. They are as funny and as bright as you might imagine.  Interesting fact: Jessica Walters dad was a great bassist and bass teacher in NYC.  As a bassist myself, its something we can bond with. I also worked with Will on  Running Wilde .  I was in NYC visiting the set, Will was there in a smoking jacket and gave me a personal tour of the mansion that they were shooting in. All in all quite surreal. ',0),(53,'davidschwartzmusic',' Was that your intention?  And if it was where do you draw inspiration to write a funnier upbeat style of music?','I may have said this before, but I always try to write music that is fun, as opposed to funny. Its very much about pace and timing. I like to reference feel good music.  Theres a lot of television music from other shows that the music is there to tell you that its funny. Wah-wah-wah waaaaaaah..pizz pizz pizz.. With Arrested, thats not necessary.  Sometimes playing the scene very seriously or over the top mock-drama can be extremely funny. ',0),(54,'davidschwartzmusic',' share the song Getaway, full version Getaway, catchy tune Getaway?','I too am hopefully hopeful.  The song should be up on the Netflix blog anytime now.  Gabriel Mann and I will be creating a full length version that will be available on the after mentioned.  ',0),(55,'davidschwartzmusic','A huge tiny mistake?','Love you too! ',0),(56,'davidschwartzmusic','In the first episode of the new season, someone passes Michael and he says  That guy thinks hes a musician. Am I completely wrong or is that you passing him?','Not me.  Jason Batemans delivery of that line is pitch perfect. I did write the score under that scene called  Shes Cute . Interestingly we made that song work in future episodes when the actors spontaneously sing a line of dialog.  Michael sings  Ive just a met a girl today  and Tobias sings  its just a phallusy  twice. Amazingly, without too much adjustment, I somehow found a way too use shes cute as an accompaniment to these ad-lib melodies. ',0),(57,'davidschwartzmusic','Was it your idea to give each characters episode in the new series its own unique flair?','When we started this season, Mitch felt it should be some how different.  Especially since each episode is usually more about a single character.  I think he came up with the idea of adding something for each character.  The woodblock solo performed by jazz great/drummer Peter Erskine, is a personal favorite of mine.',0),(58,'davidschwartzmusic',' You said how Arrested Development is  very unique  in the sense of music and how it doesnt have a formal review process of music, in what other ways is Arrested Development unique?  and do you mingle with the cast well or to they tend to kept to themselves and you yours?','I think everything in Arrested is unique as it all comes from the unique mind of Mitchell Hurwitz.  Composers are usually kept locked away in a dark studio. Its unusual to meet the cast. Although Im not hanging out with our fantastic cast, or mingling on a daily basis, I have had some opportunities to interact with them.',0),(59,'davidschwartzmusic','com/watch?  Also, are you the one or did someone else come up with  It Aint Easy Being White?','I miss Franklin.  Im hoping for a Fox spin-off next season.  That song was particularly fun to write.  I crack up whenever I hear Will sing it.  His relationship with Franklin always touches me.  ',0),(60,'davidschwartzmusic',' I cant find the song anywhere, and I just need to know if there is anywhere I can download it, or if you have it and can put it up on YouTube or something?',' Shot By Love  I co-wrote with my longtime friend, Larry John McNally. LJM sang it and its one of my faves too. Sorry it has lodged itself in your head for such a long time. I will pitch it for the soundtrack CD.',0),(61,'davidschwartzmusic','Was it hard to go back to the show and come up with the same style of music after youve been away from it for so long?','It was a challenge going back after 6 years.  I think all of us on the show felt that we had to top ourselves in every way.  Once I saw the rough cuts, I felt very comfortable.  I do feel the show has advanced musically.  ',0),(62,'davidschwartzmusic',' Do you have a version of it longer than 20 seconds? ? com/watch?','I wish! It actually might be a little bit longer. We wrote that at 1:00am and then talked Antonio Soul into coming over to sing it with Gabe. Everyones voice was totally blown out from singing and laughing.

Thanks so much.',0),(66,'davidschwartzmusic','   I guess the point of my rambling is: Do you think well get to hear some of the  unreleased  tunes from seasons 1-3 that arent yet out? com/watch?','Sorry about your dog. The tune was called  Stick it to Love  and there are many different arrangements of it; bossa, violin, solo piano etc. Thats a great suggestion for the upcoming soundtrack release. Thanks!',0),(67,'davidschwartzmusic',' I have a question- is there an edit in there or did the band flip the beat purposely?','Thats trumpeter extraordinaire, Tom Marino.

It is an edit.',0),(68,'davidschwartzmusic','Did you make the Motherboy theme and who is the singer?   Also, did you create the Hung jury?','Yes to Motherboy. A personal favorite. Gabriel Mann is once again the singer and co-writer. Of course, I was thrilled to be working with Mr. Hung.',0),(69,'davidschwartzmusic','  Can you shed any light on this?','I was there when that scene was being shot at Occidental college.  The music was already up on the black board (green board?) when I arrived.   ',0),(70,'davidschwartzmusic',' How does one break into playing on scores such as yours?','Interesting.

Just wanted to say, again thanks for considering making a donation to help NCMEC. Just today the FBI Most Wanted list included a former professor at USC who was making regular trips to the Orient and having sex with little boys. This is how expansive this problem is because its not just the guy in the dirty overcoat you need to be worried about. Theyre very well organized and many are very well-educated. Its a huge problem not just internationally but also domestically.  They have some child pornography cases that includes not even year old children, month old children. Its sickening so every dollar thats donated really goes to help the pedophilia problem on the internet.',0),(88,'thebryancranston','Have you ever pranked Aaron Paul on set?','Oh yeah, many times. There was one episode when where someone was giving us a problem and I told him to take care of it and he didnt know specifically what I meant by it. I said  I need you to take care of it  and I reached into my waistband and pulled out a gun and put it on the counter. He understood the message. Then during the scene where I said  I need you to take care of it  I reached into my waistband and pulled out a dildo.',0),(89,'thebryancranston',' Cranston, have you seen Samuel L Jacksons video where he does your  I am the danger  monologue?    What is it like finishing Breaking Bad?  Are you sad to see it go, or excited to move on and do other projects?','How is the Stig, I wonder? I did see Sammys monologue and Im going to be making one of my own from one of his monologues at some point to help with the Alzheimers research and finding the cure. I sympathize with him because my mother also had Alzheimers and its a horrible disease but he found a very interesting way to bring attention to it.  In a way Im sad to see it go but in another way Im so proud of it. To me its like retiring after winning the Super Bowl.',0),(90,'thebryancranston','What is your all time favorite movie, TV show, and food?','All-time favorite tv show is Breaking Bad, I dont know if you guys have heard of it before. When you say the Godfather, everybody says  oh the Godfather , but it was really remarkable. I loved the Andy Griffith show for its simplicity and warmth, but I also love Louis for its sardonic humor.  My favorite food is typically what I am eating at the time. But if I had to chose one, Id have to go Italian. How can you not love pasta? ',0),(91,'thebryancranston','   My question is, To what degree was the show mapped out beforehand?  Were there any characters (ie Saul, or Mike) that were originally supposed to have smaller roles, but were expanded upon?','Yeah, Jesse was not supposed to survive after the first year. He was a character that was need to introduce me into that world and then he was going to die. But Aaron Paul captured something in him that was so necessary to the fabric of the show that it was a no brainer to keep him. They knew in broad strokes where the character was going to go, but they kept resetting after each season.  ',0),(92,'thebryancranston','How did it feel to get that pizza throw perfect on the first try?','Well, I would have patted myself on the back but I was holding a pizza. Yeah, I did it in one try. It was a real pizza (a super xtra large) and very heavy. I just got lucky and it landed in the right place on the very first try so we let it be that way.',0),(93,'thebryancranston',' Would you give us YOUR best look in to WWs mind with a line or scene that maybe most people maybe dont give enough attention to?','First of all, happy birthday. Walt says today you be the danger. There was a moment nobody ever really wrote about in the first or second season.when he was in remission from his cancer and he decided even though his hair was growing back, he decided to shave his head some more. And that was  big thing for me because it made a statement that he was truly accepting this new life of his.',0),(94,'thebryancranston',' NSA, i didnt cook meth or kill anyone so fuck off)  Bryan, what was your favorite moment during Breaking Bad and why?','My favorite moment? Ill say my favorite meth moment was the teaser in season 3 where Windy was the song and they had the meth whore, Wendy, trying to score and she would give head to anyone who would drive by in order to get her fix. Juxtaposed with that bubbly song were these horrible acts where shes squatting in the alley, taking a pee. It was just nasty, nasty visuals and I thought it was brilliant.',0),(95,'thebryancranston',' How did you become involved with NCMEC and what can we, the general public, do to help?  Can you walk us through your process of directing an episode of Breaking Bad?','1. You can start by looking at www.missingkids.com and if you have children, take lots of pictures of them because if god forbid anything happens, the picture is the most important tool to retrieving any child. Thanks for your help and support.  2. Oy, the most important period in directing for me is the pre-production. The more work I get accomplished, the smoother the shoot is. Theres no shortage of hard work. You gotta be willing to put in the time and effort.',0),(96,'thebryancranston','   You seem to be such a funny person on and off set - whats it like for you to switch from doing something so funny like Malcolm in the Middle to something so deadly and serious like Breaking Bad? com/watch?','Oh no, they can post those videos. wow. What I discovered is that everyone has a dark side. It might be unrealized, untapped, but if the right buttons are pushed anyone can become dangerous and I just opened up to it. Now I dont want to say that I killed people in preparation for the role. but I cant deny it either.',0),(97,'thebryancranston','  My question for you is: At what point in the series do you believe Walter White officially broke bad?','My feeling is that Walt broke bad in the very first episode. It was very subtle but he did because thats when he decided to become someone that hes not in order to gain financially. He made the Faustian deal at that point and everything else was a slippery slope.',0),(98,'thebryancranston','Was this whole thing just an elaborate plot by Walt to get Jesse to learn chemistry?','Ha! You know there are many ways to teach people and you just have to find your own way end to stimulate the minds of young people. This was a ruse Walt designed way back when.  someday Ill pretend to be making Crystal method, get him to be my partner. Yessss, thats it. ',0),(99,'thebryancranston','What is the most inspirational thing that has ever happened to you?','Well the first thing that comes to mind is the birth of my child. If nothing inspires you to be a better person than to be a father, I dont know what would. And then Id kill her with a crane. Im on a crane kick right now. I like to see things (mostly people) get killed by cranes.',0),(100,'thebryancranston','What are your thoughts on those two infamous Cousins pulling off the Explosion in one take?','Hi Luis, good to talk to you man.

You and your brother really contributed greatly.',0),(101,'thebryancranston','At certain parts in your life/career, has it ever been difficult to maintain being humble and not egotistical in certain situations?','I think if you were born without promises or come from a middle class or lower middle class environment like I was, you have a benefit of not being entitled. Therefore humility goes along with it. I realize I am very lucky to be doing what I do. ',0),(102,'thebryancranston','Welcome to reddit! What would you be if you werent an actor at first?','Now? I dont know. But I thought about being a police man when I was younger. I was pretty close to becoming one too but in college I took some acting classes and I found that the girls were much prettier there than in police science.',0),(103,'thebryancranston',' Do ever read the script and think to yourself  im playing a real scumbag ?  Does Hank flush?','First of all Mr. Pickles. Thanks for pointing out our age difference. you little shit. Speaking of that, no he doesnt flush. And further more I think Walt is just misunderstood. Hes a lovely person.',0),(104,'thebryancranston',' Im curious how you feel about our city overall?  Also what were some of your favorite places to frequent while in town?','Albuquerque became a very important part of the show and I really enjoyed my time there. I look forward to going back at some point. You know, strolling central in Nob Hill, Church St. Cafe in Old Town, El Pinto is another place I go. And I ride for miles along the Bosque.',0),(105,'thebryancranston','Whats it like working with Aaron Paul?','Its in the past now but that was one of the saddest things, to realize that was coming to the end.

But still damn fun.',0),(110,'thebryancranston','  Do you happen to be a Steely Dan fan?','Yeah, I am.

If you received an honorary invitation to a wedding in some time, would you come?','What do the bridesmaids look like?',0),(127,'iamethanhawke','**What inspired you to become an actor? **How did you get your first big acting gig?  Did it turn out a lot better than you thought? **How was it filming for Training day with Denzel Washington? **What was the best experience you had filming and worst? **Who was one actor/actress your dying to work with, and why?','1) What inspired me to become an actor? I saw Gary Sinise and John Malkovich do Sam Shepherds play TRUE WEST on PBS when I was 13. And I can only describe the feeling as the way I hear people talk about Marlon Brando do STREETCAR; I felt like a door in my brain had been opened.   2) My first big acting gig was EXPLORERS; we have our own spaceship. And I auditioned for it on an absolute lark, and much to my parents dismay, got the part. And did it turn out better than I thought? No. I thought it was going to be one of the greatest films of all time, you know, making ET look like a minor gameshow. And - point in fact - it wasnt out a whole weekend and I went from the envy of my peers to the butt of all their jokes in a very hot second. But in hindsight, I can honestly say that nothing better could have happened to me. A) it prevented me from being a child actor; B) it prepared me for the inevitable failure that comes in a life of the arts and if you cant handle it you have to get out quick.   3) To my mind, Denzel Washington is the greatest movie star of our time. Theres nothing he cant do. And TRAINING DAY is for me like threading a needle; its very difficult to make a hit movie, and its very difficult to make a good movie, and very rarely can you accomplish both at the same time. And Denzel does it over and over again.   4) Best experience has to be the BEFORE series, just because I was involved in the writing of those movies, and they become intensely personal for me. The worst, you never want to talk about because it gets overly quoted on the internet as soon as you say something bad about something or someone, its all anyone wants to talk about. But I spent many lonely months and years in hotel rooms feeling like I was making a piss-poor movie and been depressed about it.   5) Is it okay if I say Leonardo DiCaprio? Because I know hes crazy famous and everyone wants to work with him, but I admire tremendously the way he has handled his celebrity. After the success of TITANIC, it would have been very easy for him to wind up another drug-addled casualty on the Hollywood Strip; but instead hes dedicated himself to making great films and doesnt he need an older brother? Or a bad guy? Isnt there a role for me somewhere?',0),(128,'iamethanhawke','Here are some unusual questions for you:  1) What kind of music do you listen to?   2) Do you play any instruments?  If so, which ones?   3) Any cool hobbies we show know about?   4) If you could change one thing about your life, what would it be?','1) Well, recently, believe it or not, I went into a huge Elvis Presley hole. After not listening to him my whole life, I took my daughter to Graceland and ended up feeling extremely moved by the plight of poor Mr. Presley. And Ive become obsessed with his music recently. Generally though Connor Oberst is one of the best singer-songwriters, Wilco is one of my favorite bands, and when in doubt, I will put on a Willie Nelson record.  2) I played the guitar since Robert taught me how to play on DEAD POETS SOCIETY but unfortunately Ive never had a lesson since then, so Im not very good.  3) No. Im so lucky, so much of what I would do as a hobby I do for my professional life. I love what I do. And I get to shake it up by directing in a movie, acting in a movie, directing a play, writing a book, acting in a play - ive found a way over the years to continue to shake up my job so it remains interesting to me. Im one of the handful of people who doesnt want a hobby because Id rather be doing my job.  4) I dont want to say. You know, the things that we want to change about our lives are things we dont want everybody to know, and one of the most difficult things for me was having to learn in front of the public that having a reputation is a double-edged sword. It prevents me from making a first impression. I feel like I havent made a first impression on anyone in 20 years. There are many things about my life and my behavior that I wish I could change, situations I wish I could have handled better, relationships I could have healed, but unfortunately the earth seems to turn one way and all we can do is try to learn. ',0),(129,'iamethanhawke','Did you have any inkling that Before Sunrise would turn into a trilogy?    Did you and Julie Delpy have a different approach to your roles in this movie compared to the first two films?     Will there be a fourth?','If you had told me at the wrap party for BEFORE SUNRISE that I would still be talking about this movie 20 years later, I would have thought you were insane. We knew we had a special experience, but I definitely thought it was over. After the second film, I did kind of feel that we had left something unfinished, and thats why Im enjoying the release of BEFORE MIDNIGHT so much - Ive been worrying about it for 9 years.   The approach has been incredibly consistent; the whole way weve worked on the movies has almost been like there was no time in between them at all, in fact they started to feel like one film in my head.    Sometimes I think yes, sometimes I think no - we really wont know until about 5 or 6 years from now. Im sure Rick and Julie and I will get together, and either we will have a shared sense about whats happened to Jesse and Celine, or we wont. I just wont know until then whether were going to feel compelled to make it. Theyre an incredible amount of work, so I know none of us will embark on it if we dont have a good idea.   That film - GATTACA - is made by a man named Andrew Niccol. He wrote THE TRUMAN SHOW, IN TIME, and another movie I did called LORD OF WAR - a lot of people havent seen [LORD OF WAR](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/), but to my mind its a brilliant movie. I have a small part in it, but Nic Cage is phenomenal, and so is the writing. ',0),(130,'iamethanhawke','  Can you talk about your experience so far with Boyhood, and what its like filming with the same actors over a period of years as opposed to weeks or months (especially when the lead is so young and developing personally and professionally)?','First up, I guess I should tell people what [BOYHOOD](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/) is. Its a project also known as THE TWELVE YEAR PROJECT; Richard Linklater and I have made a short film every year for the last 11 years, one more to go, that follows the development of a young boy from age 6 to 18. I play the father, and its Tolstoy-esque in scope. I thought the BEFORE series was the most unique thing I would ever be a part of, but Rick has engaged me in something even more strange. Doing a scene with a young boy at the age of 7 when he talks about why do raccoons die, and at the age of 12 when he talks about video games, and 17 when he asks me about girls, and have it be the same actor - to watch his voice and body morph - its a little bit like timelapse photography of a human being. I cant wait for people to see it.   Next year, he will graduate high school and we will finish the film. It will probably come out in 2 years.   In regards to your compliments on the BEFORE series, I wish you *could* see MIDNIGHT in theatres. Is it money, health or distance that keeps you from going out? Thanks for your support. If you like the first two, I feel pretty confident the third one will be worth your time. ',0),(131,'iamethanhawke','What was working with Nick Cage like in Lord of War?','Im kind of obsessed with Nic Cage. I just found out about /r/onetruegod too. Hes the only actor since Marlon Brando thats actually done anything new with the art of acting; hes successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours. If I could erase his bottom half bad movies, and only keep his top half movies, he would blow everyone else out of the water. Hes put a little too much water in his beer, but he is still one of the great actors of our time. And working with him was an absolute pleasure. In fact, one of my favorite scenes Ive ever done is the last scene in LORD OF WAR. ',0),(132,'iamethanhawke','Do you get much time to write in between movies?  And do you write regularly, in one place, have any weird writing habits or lucky charms?','Well, the funny thing is, Ive been working on 3 different projects over the past 10 years writing-wise, and thats why its taken me so long to finish. I have a novel that is almost done, I was worried Id published ASH WEDNESDAY too quickly after THE HOTTEST STATE. I think I was too anxious to prove to myself that I wasnt a dilettante, and I wrote the second book a little too quickly. Ive challenged myself on the third to take more time with it. Four kids have challenged me too. But I will finish my third novel this summer.   Simultaneously, Ive finished a YA book that will come out soon as well. Ive been writing the text for a graphic novel that Greg Ruth will illustrate- he did an amazing book called BORN ON THE BATTLEFIELD.  So Ive been working on these three projects for the past 10 years, and I havent finished any of them! But Im working on it. I try to challenge myself to simply keep a journal, and to write a little bit every day, whether Im making a movie or not making a movie.  That way, when I do have time, when Im not working as an actor, I have material I can draw from and start to work with. ',0),(133,'iamethanhawke','  When making a horror or scary movie with children, what do they do to keep the kids (younger ones) from being completely messed up from the really dark stuff?   Do they just do some sort of interview and casting stuff to make sure the kids are mature enough and realize its all made up?   Is it just not that creepy while actually shooting the creepy stuff?','GREAT question! As a child actor myself, Im incredibly sensitive to this and kind of hate acting with kids for all the same concerns that are present in your question. But with a scary movie, it surprised me, because kids love to play. They love costumes, they love Halloween. The kids on-set treated the making of the movie as if we were all doing an elaborate haunted house; think about it, kids love to play Hide &amp; Seek, they love to scare you and each other, and I was really relieved to see them all playing and laughing and understanding the spirit of a good ghost story. It really wasnt difficult for them at all.',0),(134,'iamethanhawke','I notice you own an island. Whats the best part of island ownership?','I own an 8 acre island off the coast of Nova Scotia; there are eagles, and seals, and raccoons, and pine trees for days. Believe it or not, land is actually quite affordable up there, and its still rugged and un-gentrified. The people are straightforward and a pleasure to be around; I try to take my kids up there at least once a year. Its a place to disappear in the many times in my life when Ive needed to.',0),(135,'iamethanhawke','Whats the buying process like when shopping for an island?  Did you look at more than one?','Thats a funny question, and deserves to be answered. One does not shop for an island; I have friends in Nova Scotia, and often visited them, one of whom was an older woman who could no longer take care of her island, and she asked if I would buy it. A closet in Manhattan costs more than an island in Nova Scotia. So I answered yes. And Im happy I did. ',0),(136,'iamethanhawke',' Also, do you think there will be a sequel to Daybreakers?','You know, I feel the same way - my hope is that that movie was going to be much more successful than it was. The guys who made it, the Spierig Brothers, are two young men who are crazy-talented and when we started shooting that movie, TWILIGHT hadnt come out, TRUE BLOOD hadnt come out, I was excited because I thought it was time for a new vampire film. little did I know, but by the time the fx were done, vampires would be passe. We had a hope that DAYBREAKERS would be our MAD MAX to a much better film that could be THE ROAD WARRIOR - because those guys, if ever given a big budget, could really accomplish something major I think. I just worked with them again, in a film called PREDESTINATION - and I have a secret hope that its going to be really special. Its based on a Robert Heinlein short story called  All You Zombies  and it aspires to be the greatest time travel movie ever made. ',0),(137,'iamethanhawke','how old will real life Ethan Hawke be when the science of Gattaca is commonplace?','Well, did she like EXPLORERS?   Regarding GATTACA, the scary thing is how prescient its turning out to be, in that its primary statement that seemed radical at the time that we made it was that in the future our identity - our place of work - would be more powerful than our identity to any country. And more and more, I see that happening, where there are a handful of corporations that determine the choices of our life more than our presidents and prime ministers. And then obviously genetic discrimination, which is becoming a wildly interesting subject matter. Id like to recommend Andrew Solomons book [FAR FROM THE TREE](http://www.farfromthetree.com) - its an excellent book on the subject of how our differences are what make us human, and what we perceive as disability is quite often something very different.',0),(138,'iamethanhawke',' Is it easy to put yourself into it?','When we set out to make BEFORE SUNRISE, Julie and I had a lot of apprehension about the level of dialogue Linklater wanted to be in the movie.  Nothings happening! Shouldnt it at least be funny? Is this boring?  and Rick answered that hed never been in a helicopter crash, hed never been involved in any espionage, hed never been to Outer Space, and yet his life felt full of drama. And the most dramatic thing that ever happened to him was the experience of truly connecting with another person. And he really wanted to try to make a movie about that, about that connection, about that exchange of energy, ideas, and all the dialogue in BEFORE SUNRISE, SUNSET and MIDNIGHT is chasing that connection. So whether its about politics, love, identity, spiritual yearning, sex - anything at all - its written with the goal of trying to uncover  the space between  two people. ',0),(139,'iamethanhawke','Hey Mr. Hawke,  Any advice for a wannabe scriptwriter in college?','Write every day. Not every other day. Not tomorrow. Not after the party. But before. The more you write, the more comes out of you. If you dont give inspiration an opportunity, it will never arrive. ',0),(140,'iamethanhawke','Hi Ethan  What was the most impressive in the advice of Sidney Lumet ?','It will always be one of my greatest honors was to act in Sidney Lumets last film. It was such a strange experience to be directed by a man who directed Marlon Brando in his prime, who directed Al Pacino in DOG DAY AFTERNOON, Faye Dunaway in NETWORK.   If youre really interested in his advice, he has a really wonderful book called MAKING MOVIES; I remember I read almost the whole thing on the floor of the Barnes &amp; Noble here in Manhattan when I was about 20 years old. He has a very no-bullshit approach; he talks about making movies almost the way one would talk about building a home. No fanfare, no mystery, just brass tacks. And he pushed Phil Hoffman, Marisa Tomei and I to some of our finest work, and all of us are grateful. And if I had to boil his advice down to one thing, it would be preparation. ',0),(141,'iamethanhawke','?','My kids and I always have a debate about if the positives outweigh the negatives. Great seats to the Nicks game vs. being hounded for autographs at halftime. Every give has a take. For me, the blessings far outweigh the curses. I consider it a kind of luxury tax. For my family, I think its more difficult; they dont get to work with Denzel Washington and Sidney Lumet, but they still have the paparazzi.

Apply on Craigslist.',0),(143,'iamethanhawke','Whats the most difficult scene youve had to preform and what made it so difficult?','Theres a scene when my character Jake in TRAINING DAY is left for dead with a Mexican cholo gang; that still haunts my dreams sometimes. Also.  People dont ever want to hear this, because it destroys the fantasy, but anytime you have to kiss anybody, its never stopped being strange. ',0),(144,'iamethanhawke','What was it like working with river Phoenix?','River was one of those people that had that strange magic glow around them; he could drive you crazy, or make you fall in love with him, sometimes in the same minute. I remember knowing he was special when in the first days of filming EXPLORERS - we were staying in a motel outside of San Francisco, and I saw him practicing his characters walk in the parking lot one of the mornings before shooting began. Uncommon behavior for a 13-year old. He had a big, beautiful family, and was the first vegetarian I ever met. ',0),(145,'iamethanhawke','How scary is Phillip Seymour Hoffman in real life?','When I first met Phil, he was often the reader when I would go in to audition for something - the kind of actor that wasnt going to get the part, but he was good, so they hired him to read with all the other guys auditioning. He was intimidating then, and hes intimidating now. What a lot of people dont know about him is that hes a member of the Labyrinth Theater company here in New York, and is a truly phenomenal theatrical director. His production of THE LAST DAYS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT is one of the best evenings in the theatre Ive ever spent. ',0),(146,'iamethanhawke','I love scary movies, and Sinister really scared the shit out of me. Were there any parts during filming/when you were watching the final film that you freaked you out or caught you completely off guard?','The thing that really caught me off-guard was how much fun it was to make a scary movie. Id spent my whole career avoiding them, I think because I thought it would be terrifying to do one. But thats like assuming a comedy would be fun to shoot; its not, necessarily. There was a real feeling on the set of SINISTER of that goofy, edgy feeling that you get when a friend tells a story around a campfire late at night and everybody gets the chills. Its just as funny as it is scary. You need a good director to make a scary movie. The difference between a moment being terrifying and a moment being laughably stupid has to do with the music and the cutting; I felt in that film a real beneficiary of Scott Derricksons direction.',0),(147,'iamethanhawke','Hey Mr. Hawke, who are some of the directors you admire and would like to work with in the future?','You know, Ive never worked with Spike Lee, and I just think he is one of the most interesting filmmakers around. Time has proved him to be the real thing. But the truth is that if I could only make one more movie, and I could make it with anyone in the world, I would really want to make another movie with Richard Linklater. Ever since I saw SLACKER, and DAZED AND CONFUSED, I feel like hes had a very rare and unique voice in movies. And as an actor, thats always the highest bar, to be a part of something that could feasibly be original. Thats the hardest thing to accomplish. ',0),(148,'iamethanhawke',' But, my first introduction to you (and Kurt) was through a Slaughterhouse Five audiobook (that is you, right?','I went to a Kurt Vonnegut reading at the 92nd street Y, because I too am a big Vonnegut fan - SLAPSTICK, GALAPAGOS, SIRENS OF TITAN, and BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS being among my favorites. I told him all of this, and a couple weeks later, I got a message from my agent saying Id been requested to do the reading - I dont know if those 2 were connected, but I imagine that they were. Later I heard via the grapevine that he LOVED that reading and it made me really happy. I remember when we met I told him how much I loved SLAPSTICK and he said it wasnt a very good book.

If you could commit any crime, aside from murder, which crime would you most like to commit and why?','If I could do anything without repercussions, I would become the worlds biggest badass, most fierce environmental terrorist. I would make all the bastards who profit from destroying our planet regret the day they were born. Think natural-born vigilante. ',0),(150,'iamethanhawke','Were you aware of Reddit before this AMA?    Do you think youll be back, (even if its just to lurk)?     What do you do with your  down time ?','This is my first day of my life having any idea that this site even exists; Im having a ball at the exact moment, and I dont know what I am going to do tomorrow. You could really do an interesting scene in a play based on reddit though.  In my downtime, I hang out with my children. I have a 2 year old, a 5 year old, an 11 year old and a 15 year old, so theres always somebody that wants some attention.',0),(151,'iamethanhawke','What is it like to be physically immortal?','You know, thats the greatest myth of acting in movies, is this idea of immortality. In a way, Ive found that my theatre performances age less than my film performances, because they only exist in peoples memories. When someone comes up to me and says I saw you in HURLY BURLY, their face lights up, and I can see the performance is alive in their brain, right there, and it also means that one day we were in the same room together, we had a shared experience. They might say, it was Christmas night, it was snowing, it started 25 minutes late, and Ill say  I remember  and that evening is very much alive for the both of us. Whereas when I show EXPLORERS to my children, its obvious to me that film is aging. ',0),(152,'iamethanhawke','  What has been your favorite acting experience so far?  When will we get a chance to see Before Midnight here?','Well, thank you, and I think one of my favorite acting experiences is something unfortunately in Denver you woudnt have been able to see, but I did a new Sir Tom Stoppard play called THE COAST OF UTOPIA - that we only performed in its entirety a handful of times as its 12 hours long (with several intermissions). We would start performances at 11 AM, and we would do our curtain call at 11 PM. There was a lunch break and a dinner break, obviously, but it was about the mid-19th century Russian radicals; you could read it, but Stoppard is one of the few no-nonsense geniuses Ive met in my life, and it was a pleasure to be in the rehearsal room for 9 months. If you read it, I played Mikhail Bakunin and Billy Crudup played Belinsky.',0),(153,'iamethanhawke',' Since there were three people who had their hand in writing the screenplay for Before Midnight, does that mean you all had equal influence over what the characters said and did, or did you and Delpy get to have creative influence only with respect to your own characters?','I imagine that it would be easy to think that Julie writes her dialogue and I write mine; the truth is that the three of us, Richard, Julie and myself, sit in a room for somewhere around 10-12 weeks and talk about Jesse and Celine. We talk about where they might be developmentally, and Julie has helped construct Jesse as much as Ive helped construct Celine, and Richard is a big part of both those characters as well. In the first one, we largely wrote our own dialogue, because there was a pre-existing script, but in the second and third, the three of us, from outline-forward, were a part of every line.',0),(154,'iamethanhawke','Whats your most memorable moment while filming Dead Poets Society?   What was Robin Williams like on set of that film?','The most memorable scene was the  I sound my barbaric yawp from the rooftops of the world  scene; I had to make up a poem in front of the classroom, and it was the only time I really had to  work  with Robin Williams. And I feel like it was the first time I was ever really challenged to act.   I think Ive already answered what actor I would like to work with - Leo!  - but thank you for your questions.',0),(155,'iamethanhawke',' What was it like to do a Marathon of plays (with such heavy dialogue?','Well, I wish you remembered that I was in all 3 plays, it makes me somehow feel that I did a poor job in one of them. As I mentioned before, it was definitely the highlight of a 20 year acting career, and the fact that you were there fills me with admiration for YOU because hard as it was to perform them all day, I cant imagine having the power of concentration to WATCH them all day. It was the one time in my life I came out for a curtain call when I wanted to applaud the audience.',0),(156,'iamethanhawke','  do you still enjoy Tang?','I will always have a soft spot for Tang, no matter how vile it tastes, because when my father and I used to go camping, for breakfast we would have granola bars and Tang. For lunch we would have wolfs chili and Tang. And for dinner we would have hot dogs and Tang.',0),(157,'iamethanhawke',' Did you enjoy making that movie?','I know youre supposed to say this kind of thing, but its one of my favorite films that Ive done. I know that audiences have always loved TRAINING DAY, but in many ways, BROOKLYNS FINEST is the East coast sequel. Antoine Fuqua (who directed both films) has a real special feel for capturing the street. And both Jake (from TRAINING DAY) and Sal (from BROOKLYNS FINEST) are two of my favorite characters that Ive gotten to play; one the good guy, one the bad guy. ',0),(158,'iamethanhawke','Cats or dogs?','Well, I have a dog named Nina and a cat named Rascal. If I had to choose, Id have to choose the one that loves me back.',0),(159,'iamethanhawke','I love all of your movies Ethan! Whats your favorite place to visit?','You know, we set the opening of BEFORE SUNSET in a bookstore in Paris called Shakespeare And Company, and I think that would have to go down as my favorite place to visit. Its right there on the Seine overlooking Notre Dame and has a long history of some of the great minds in literature passing through the doors, and theres a feel there that is unlike any other place Ive ever been. ',0),(160,'iamethanhawke','Which was the freakiest scene of The Purge to shoot?','The whole movie was freaky. The concept is freaky. Every day of the shoot was kind of intense and surreal. Hard for me to pinpoint, but the actor who plays the main villain - Rhys Wakefield - his performance seemed like he was channeling Satan himself. So I would have to say anytime I acted with him. ',0),(161,'iamethanhawke','Whats your favourite food?','Chips and salsa. I could eat it for every meal.',0),(162,'iamethanhawke',' Any new novels coming our way?  Have you considered updating us on these characters?','Yes, I have a third novel that is at the publishers office now and this summer, I am going to dedicate a couple months to proofreading it and getting it ready for you to read. I dont know if Im going to be revisiting the same characters, but Im definitely revisiting the same themes.',0),(163,'iamethanhawke','Hey, youre from Austin, TX.

Do I look that creepy? One of the things that sucks about getting older is that you start to look kind of creepy. ',0),(167,'realhanszimmer',' How has your personal involvement with any of the series/concepts youve scored affected your work on that project?  For example, are you a really big fan of any character/idea you happened to compose for?  What sort of music do you like to listen to in your free time?  Whats one unexpected place youve found inspiration for some of your work?','1.) You have to fall in love with the characters, and at the same time, you always have to put a part of yourself into the character. I grew up with comic books, so I am a huge Superman fan, so that actually became very daunting because I didnt want to ruin one of my favorite characters for a whole generation. It was interesting working on *Thelma and Louise* and having to try to find a female voice or point of view in me.  2.) Anything from LCD Soundsystem to film scores - Im a soundtrack nerd- to the music of my people, Kraftwerk.  3.) Unexpected place? One of the great guilty pleasures of working on movies is that you get to go to places that other people sometimes cant go to, so being alone at the Louvre at night, in front of the Mona Lisa for *The Da Vinci Code* made that one worthwhile.   4.) The sounds I hear in my head, my head is quite a good instrument.  Thank you, thank you- what else can you say to that? Thank you for the compliment.',0),(168,'realhanszimmer',' **What was your inspiration for this piece?  Or tell me something about your experience creating this piece? **  - Of all of your work on film, what is your most favorite composition that you wrote, and why is it your favorite?   - What can we expect from the music in Man of Steel?','For  This Land  - the whole *Lion King* soundtrack is really me dealing with my fathers death, which up to that point I had never really done, because children suppress things, and I was rather surprised that, in a cartoon with fuzzy animals, I was suddenly confronted with my past. The other thing is, because I wrote it for my daughter, it connected the generations over time through music.   My favorite composition that I wrote.I find fault with all of it, nothing is ever finished, thats why I carry on writing, and part of what I like is influenced by the people I am working with. So some of my favorites have more to do with process than the actual end result. So a Zack Snyder or a Chris Nolan seem to bring out some pretty good things in me.  For *Man of Steel* you can expect hope. Hope and no cynicism. The opposite of *The Dark Knight.* Trying to celebrate hard-working, simple, blue-collar people in the Midwest who never get celebrated. ',0),(169,'realhanszimmer','  My question is firstly whether or not film scoring should be pursued professionally, or is it better to pursue some other aspect in music, while learning film scoring as a side aspect, or if I enjoy it then should I pursue it professionally?  Is it easy to establish a firm ground in the industry of film scoring?    How does the creativity come about?  How do you manage so many instruments, producing the sound you want?','It is impossible to establish a firm ground in the industry of film scoring. I still feel petrified that I live and die by whatever my last piece of music is. I like film scoring because I love stories, and its my way of telling a story. I get my music from the stories and from looking at the images, so I think if you want to become a good film scorer, look at books, look at paintings.   In regards to managing so many instruments, with the help of a good conductor. But Im a synthesizer geek, so I like making my own sounds, and I can get lost for days trying to make the perfect bass sound. I have heard that a photo of my studio by Trey Radcliffe has been very popular on reddit in the past; I actually assembled my collection of Moog synthesizers when everybody was embracing digital and throwing out the old analog stuff. God, were they wrong. The thing that pins you to your seat in *Dark Knight* or *Man of Steel* is Professor Moogs 40-year-old invention.',0),(170,'realhanszimmer','Dear Hans Zimmer, why is your music so epic that it turns every movie I watch and every game I play intro an experience to remember?  As for the more serious question, which of the upcoming project areyou the most excited about?  Can you spill some beans?','Regarding epic - I dont know why my music is so epic, its just how I hear things in my head. I use very simple devices and tunes. Its usually not the size of the orchestra or the production that makes things sound epic, its usually the commitment of the players. A great string quartet can sound louder when they play with fire and heart, than a boring orchestra, and a single note by Jeff Beck can slice right through your heart.  For upcoming projects, I am really excited about *Rush*, which was just really fun to work on, and I think that its the first race car movie that really got it right. And I was honored working with Steve McQueen on *12 Years A Slave,* which is a phenomenal, daring movie with a story that needed to be told. And Im starting to have a little fun with Chris Nolan on his next project, *Interstellar.*',0),(171,'realhanszimmer','  As for a question, if you could compose a theme for any person - historical, alive, dead, fictional, real - who would it be?   And since you mentioned you love truth or dare, what is the best dare you can come up with on the spot?','If I could compose a theme for any person - I love Elgars Enigma Variations, where he wrote a set of symphonic pieces, each one depicting one of his friends, including a dog. I always loved that idea. I would write about the people I love, except I dont ever seem to have the time to write anything! But one day Ill get around to it.   Best dare I can come up with on the spot - for me, it was such a dare to even tackle *Man of Steel* because i didnt want to ruin it for a whole generation! I grew up with loving the John Williams score to *Superman* and the greatest dare is always to get over my own paranoia, neuroses, and all other insecurities a composer suffers every moment of the day. Its a little bit like standing naked on a cold day on the beach in front of the most beautiful girl.',0),(172,'realhanszimmer',' Can you talk a little bit more about the piece?  Do you use music to cope?','I found out about the Aurora shooting in the middle of an interview, and the journalist asked me to comment, and all I could come up with were the word  devastated and shocked.  And I suddenly realized that my language was music. And I wanted to write a piece of music that would show the people in Aurora that the whole world was there with them. It was the only response I could have, to put beauty against violence, and that we are all alone in this together.   I wanted the music to bring everybody together. Because you can only set art against violence. Nothing else seems to have worked so far.    I want to continue to create art that makes people think, and talk to each other. Use your words, not your guns. ',0),(173,'realhanszimmer',' Like whats your go to DAW?  What are your go to plugins?  Do you use many virtual instruments or mainly track real instruments?   Any other recording/tracking tips and tricks youd like to share?','I use Cubase; all the UAD plugins; and Zebra, which is to me the greatest software synth ever built. We build a lot of our own technology at RCP, so our sampler and touchscreens are custom-built. One of my greatest ambitions is to keep orchestral music alive, so I try to use as many live musicians as I possibly can. For example, I just had the honor of employing 15 of the greatest drummers in the world for *Man of Steel* and using 8 pedal-steel players at the same time. I think it was a world first.   For tips, Id say write a good piece. I spend forever getting the arrangement right. Find the best musicians you can, and leave it up to a really good recording engineer. ',0),(174,'realhanszimmer','  On your average score, how much % of what we hear are synth orchestra, and how much of it is real?  Whats the relation?','I just tweak around until it sounds good to me. It never sounds as good as it sounds when I first think of it, so a lot of fiddling with synthesizers goes on to get it a little closer to my first sonic vision. The live orchestra gives it an energy and a humanity that you just cant get out of the electronics, so trying to strike a balance. All musical instruments are technological devices; it doesnt matter if its electronic or if its made from a tree with bits of dead cat attached.

I will absolutely score more games in the future.',0),(181,'realhanszimmer',' Do you ever consider or think about how people listen to your music when you compose or are you 100% going for the feeling of the movie?','When I write the score, I only think about the characters and the story, but when I try to put the soundtrack album together, I try to actually make it a good listening experience. I actually work very hard to try to be responsible at delivering a decent soundtrack album, and not just make it an afterthought to the movie.

Do you think that everything we hear can be music, or does music have to follow a standard or lets say have a minimum of criteria to be officially called  music , in which case, what are those criteria?   And do you think people who learn music later on, like after the age of 20, can still become musicians or is there a specific age you need to learn music at in order to be a true musician?','I think organized noise becomes music; I try to be appropriate to the story that we are trying to tell, but I try to find new ways of telling it. There have been many Sherlock Holmes movies before I started writing for it, and it was just my way of finding a new take, but I think its true to the intellectual curiosity that Conan Doyle gave his character. ',0),(184,'realhanszimmer','Which composition of yours took the longest to complete?','Notes per minute? Probably the Clark Kent theme from *Man of Steel* because I was procrastinating for so long, trying to shake off the enormous shadow that John Williams *Superman* theme cast.',0),(185,'realhanszimmer','If you would had the chance to score for one movie which has already been released, which would it be?','Blade Runner. But I love what Vangelis did so much, so not really. ',0),(186,'realhanszimmer','Dear Hans,    I have noticed that you use some pretty unusual sounds in some of your scores. What is your process for creating some of these sounds?','Anarchy - but seriously, I start every project off by trying to figure out what my color palette is, and I spend weeks programming sounds and going out and recording strange instruments. For *The Lone Ranger*, we just took a sledgehammer to a train recently - you dont get to do that every day. Were going to use that as a percussion element.',0),(187,'realhanszimmer','jpg), anything planned for Nintendo ?  Any (new) projects ?','Im actually in a dedicated Nintendo room, but not at Nintendo. Although Id be open to doing a project with them, nothing is in the works right now. although Batman, Superman, Super Mario.',0),(188,'realhanszimmer','  I am curious, **who are some of the composers and works who most influenced you, and is there anyone relatively new in the score world who has impressed you?','Its very simple - I find if you want a well-rounded musical education, just listen to composers whose names begin with  B.  Bach, Beethoven, Beatles, BB King, Burt Bacharach, Berlioz. But not Bruckner. Its always amazing that my simplistic music seems to touch complete strangers, and somehow we have a connection and a conversation through that music. So thank you.',0),(189,'realhanszimmer','Dear Mr. Zimmer,  If there was one composer from any point in history that you could go back and meet, who would it be and why?','Beethoven, because those first 4 notes of the Fifth are so simple and how did he know that he could create such magic with them?',0),(190,'realhanszimmer','Dear Mr. Zimmer,   Of Nolans Batman films, which was your favorite to score?','The third, because it brought everything together - after all, it was nine years of our lives, and I think we became a very good family in that time. It was hard to say goodbye to that character.',0),(191,'realhanszimmer','Mr. Zimmer,  How many times would you generally watch a film during the composition process of a Score?','Im like a cat, I have 9 lives. After 9 complete viewings, I find it difficult to feel anything new, so I usually work from the first impressions and try to hang onto those for dear life.',0),(192,'realhanszimmer',' Do you agree with this assessment, or do you have another personal favorite?','Im far too close to it to judge. We had our premiere last night, and at the afterparty, I and some of my musician friends got to play the music live. And towards the end of it, I was actually thinking  This is fun to play.  And thats always a good sign.',0),(193,'realhanszimmer',' but what the process in making Time?   Where did the inspiration come from?','Even though I never told him, it was really a thank you to my friend Chris Nolan for letting me work on this incredible movie. That made me think about time and our existence and dreams and love for a whole year - what a luxury to have. ',0),(194,'realhanszimmer','Hans, what do you do when youre stuck on something?   How do you clear out the cobwebs to gain insight?','I read a book, or look at a Gerhard Richter painting. Have a heated discussion with my director. Talk to a great chef about great food. Thats always inspiring. ',0),(195,'realhanszimmer','  Do you find there is any difference between composing for a video game as opposed to movies?  Is one more challenging than the other?','Yes - i find that not knowing who the player of the final videogame is very difficult because Im trying (and I still havent figured it out) how to not generalize. In a movie I can always be specific about the character. Glad to hear you enjoy the music, thank you!',0),(196,'realhanszimmer','  What was it like to work with the Simpsons staff?','Being the  new kid  in a family thats been together for 25 years was fairly daunting.

',0),(198,'realhanszimmer','HZ,  What do you feel has changed the film scoring industry over the course of your career for the better?  For the worse?','Whos changed the industry? The writers and directors giving us great stories to write to. Remember, weve been in 3-D forever, because weve had 5.1 - the visuals are only just now catching up! And it seems music is not the ugly stepsister of cinematography anymore. ',0),(199,'realhanszimmer','Hey Hans, do you look forward to teach someone the art of producing film music in the future?','I was an assistant to the great composer Stanley Myers, and I learned through his mentorship how to become a film composer. I try to do the same now with my studio, with young composers. ',0),(200,'realhanszimmer',' My question is, do you like electronic dance music, like house or trance?','I work very closely with my friend Junkie XL on *Man of Steel* - I come from electronic music, and have always tried to bridge the divide between classical and electronics.

If so, what is the most random situation you found yourself in where the nutmeg came in handy?','1) Thanks for your comment.  I do think there is too much emphasis on  diets  and not enough of simply eating well.  The truth is, its simple.eat your veggies, lay off the red meat and sweets, drink plenty of water and exercise. 2) I have a grater and nutmeg at all times.  I use it a lot on bad coffee, which is most of the coffee in encounter. ',0),(205,'thealtonbrown','  Have you ever wanted a role as a competitor?  Do you ever hang out with other Food Network stars?   If so, what do you do?   If not, what do you do for fun?','I have no desire to compete.Im just not that kind of guy.not that way at least.  I dont hang out with Food Network stars because, well.I dont really fit in with the big  A  list stars and the young folk think Im old.  So, Im kinda on a  C  list all by myself, which is perfectly fine.   As for fun.Ill get back to you. ',0),(206,'thealtonbrown',' The burning question we have is, How much do the chefs know about the ingredient beforehand?','Heres the honest answer (as far as I know): about a week before the competition, the chefs are given a list of 8 possible ingredients.  They have to be prepared for all of them.  I also should tell you that Ive been told that on the Japanese version they just flat out told them.but that could be a nasty rumor.

There are about 100 titles in heavy rotation.  But youre right, I check myself against McGee whenever I have the chance.  I dont always agree with him but in those cases I usually keep my mouth shut. ',0),(209,'thealtonbrown','Hi Alton, long time fan here, thank you very much for doing this AMA. Is there anything youve touted on Good Eats as a  golden rule  that you have changed your opinion on?','Yes.  I really messed up with cooking pasta in season 1.

',0),(210,'thealtonbrown','  How did it feel when they finally recanted?     Also, what is your favorite dish that you normally make for dinner?','Well, its not like I actually had anything to do with that.

',0),(211,'thealtonbrown','What correctable mistakes do you think most home cooks unknowingly commit?','I think that a lot of home cooks miscalculate heat.  We seem to be a bit afraid of it but must master it to be true cooks.  Heat is elemental to the process',0),(212,'thealtonbrown','Hi Alton! What is the one food that Food Network would not let you make an episode of Good Eats about, that you wanted to do the most?','Food Network has always been very supportive of me and theyve let me get away with a lot but when I said  sweetbreads  they said  no.   Same with rabbit. ',0),(213,'thealtonbrown','  Ill jump right into this non-food question, is it true you carry a 1911?','Actually a 1911 is a little heavy for every day carry unless its a Browning 9 hi-power which is essentially a 1911.  I carry a Kimber Solo a fair bit. ',0),(214,'thealtonbrown','What were your impressions of Jamie and Adam during your time on Mythbusters?','Heros.no other way to say it.

Im not very good at keeping up with that kind of thing. ',0),(216,'thealtonbrown','Alton, I make my soft pretzels with lye, on your show you said you can use baking soda.

',0),(217,'thealtonbrown','Is there any food trend going on that just makes you roll your eyes?','I dont understand the whole  raw  thing.

',0),(220,'thealtonbrown','  Is this just the nature of the recipe or are there any tips for helping it firm up a bit more?','It sounds like you might be pulling it a little underdone.  Add 5 more minutes to the cooking, or turn off the oven and leave it for another 10. And make sure its thoroughly chilled before cutting. ',0),(221,'thealtonbrown','   I have two questions: What drove you into the culinary world?  What was your favorite homemade meal growing up?','My favorite homemade meal was my moms spaghetti.  I was driven into food because its the universal subject.everyone loves food.  Its what connects all of us to each other. ',0),(222,'thealtonbrown','   Is there any one thing that you think everyone should know about the food industry or food in general?','The best food is always the food you cook yourself or that is cooked for you by someone who loves you.

',0),(264,'johnfogerty',' Was there anyone you wanted to have on the new record, but couldnt?  Do you ever get tired of playing CCR songs after all these years?  If you had to choose three songs to represent your career, what would those songs be and why?','1. Yes, but I dont want to reveal who they might be. There were a few. I think it would be unfair to reveal cause it was mostly about scheduling. These are artists I really love, and you never know - maybe Ill get to cross paths with those mystery guests sometime in the future.   2. Well the actual complete answer is, for a long time I didnt play my early CCR hits because of so much bad feeling between myself and the original record company and also with the other members of CCR. It was a very complicated and confusing and hurtful state of affairs for me. So after meeting my beautiful wife Julie and falling deeply in love and also in love with life in general, my heart re-imbraced that music for all the right reasons, starting with the fact that I had written all these songs in the first place. I am now able to have a very strong affection for this music I created. i love singing Proud Mary, Born on the Bayou, I love singing Have You Ever Seen the Rain with an audience. Its one of the great joys of being a musician, to share that experience with an audience.  3. First song I would choose is Joy of My Life, because - I know things like this get a little corny to some people, but its not corny to me. Im the guy thats living it. In so many profound ways, Im just grateful my heart was reclaimed by Miss Julie. Second I would have to say Proud Mary amazingly because at the time I wrote it, I just knew it was a really great song. Theres a connection there I cant really explain. Theres some kind of mystical knowledge I was given almost like clairvoyance, to see the future even tho I was still living on $20 a week. For some reason, God let me realize this thing was far above what I had ever done before, and someone that everything was gonna turn out OK. Im sure glad he didnt tell me it was gonna take 40 years! If I had to pick a third, its a tie between Mystic Highway and Train of Fools. I really enjoy MH for many reasons. In some way, I have the same feeling I did about Proud Mary. Dont know why this song landed on me like this but Im sure glad it did. At the same time, if this was the olden days, the B side would have been Train of Fools. I must admit the visceral side of me really loves Train of Fools - how it sounds, soulful way its played, dark mystery of lyrics. It happens to be one of those songs I played in my car for weeks after it was finally done. Hate to admit I do that sort of thing cause I usually dont, but Train of Fools was so rock n roll. I love that song.',0),(265,'johnfogerty','  What did you learn - if anything - from this experience?   Do you think the case had any merit?','Came to trial in 1988. This is a complicated story and Ill try to explain it even tho it gets weirder when I try to type it. I really dont think the case had merit. For instance, when my album Centerfield first came out, I heard a rumor that Fantasy was going to sue me, but at first they were talking about the song Green River. Later they changed their mind to Run Through the Jungle. Seemed they were searching to find something they owned that sounded similar to The Old Man Down the Road. Obviously I finally ended up in a courtroom where I sang a little of both songs and showed how my style on the guitar evolved, making many of the things I do sound similar musically  Every artist in the world actually spends a lifetime hoping he will find  a style.  That is a style. A musical style. If youre lucky enough to find one, it means you are instantly recognizable to the listener. Byt he way, the case was, I believe, really clear when Fantasys musical expert played a computerized version of each song with a series of beeps coming out of the speaker. He explained that if the songs were the same, you would only hear one note at the song. If you heard two beeps at the same time, the melodies werent the same. As weve now come to learn in our internet world where you click the button and there it goes, the man in the courtroom clicked the button. Three notes - same melody. Rest of the way was 2 beeps. I chuckled to myself cause the man had blown his own case. Proved the songs were not similar, but uniquely different.  I didnt argue the case in front of the Supreme Court. There was argued my right to get my attorneys fees back. Wasnt built in uniquely in cases like this. The deck was really stacked against me and all songwriters. Fact that they made that ruling is very important for songwriters from now on. Vote was 11-0.',0),(266,'johnfogerty',' Im a guitarist, and ive always been curious how you got that amazing tone for many of your CCR songs?','Tone - wow. You spend a lifetime thinking about tone, worrying about tone. I realize here I am probably being a guitar geek and so I may have a selective audience who even worries about this part. I was very lucky back in the day things were still analog, not digital. I formed my values early on from the correct realm. Im sure youve all heard other artists rant about how digital sucks the life and tone out of their music, and in some ways thats true. I grew up loving the great tone of people like Duane Eddy, Bo Diddley, Chet Atkins, Lowman Pauling from the group The Five Royals. Give yourself a treat - go look up the Five Royals and play these three songs - Think, Dont Let it Be in Vain, and most notably Slummer the Slum. You will have trouble sleeping until you figure those out. Basically, my answer about tone is the simpler, the better. I love to plug in a great guitar, which already sounds good, into a great amp. A handwired point-to-point amp. Vintage  snob, boutique  amps you can get nowadays. Summing it up - first time I picked up a Les Paul custom guitar in Albany, CA, plugged it in to a Fender Blackface Amp (A twin? maybe a deluxe) in 1969, I think February.. I tuned the guitar down to D, kind of like in Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising. I played one E chord which came out as a D chord. I believe I was on the bridge pickup. The sound that came out was the opening chord of Midnight Special. Even to this day, when I play that chord live in front of an audience, I always take a moment to revel in how great that sounds. The red seas have parted.',0),(267,'johnfogerty','  I see that you are working with a lot of country musicians, do you always have seen yourself as a country artist?   Whatdo you think is the difference between country music and rock?   How was working with Brad Paisley? ?','Growing up, I was greatly influenced and had great admiration for many country artists. Im not sure I ever saw myself as a country artist. What I always felt I was, was pretty much a mainstream rock n roll kid growing up, listening to rock radio. In those times when I was young, rock n roll really embraced a lot of other styles of music and simply called it rock n roll. Id quote people like Carl Perkins, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Conway Twitty- there were so many that seemed to flow in from the country wing of rock n roll. But then again, lots of great artists like Ray Charles, Solomon Burke. and to be a little esoteric, Harry Belafonte, Pete Seger - these were all people who had a different take. We as the audience loved them in rock n roll. I just grew up loving good music. My own tastes were formed by these and many many more great artists. One of the parts of country Ive always admired was there seemed to be so many fabulous musicians. Sort of player who sits on his front porch and play mandolin, banjo, acoustic guitar, bluegrass kinda wild and crazy pickin on all those instruments. I wanted to grow up and be like Chet Atkins. Rock n roll began as more powerful and louder music. Somewhere in the 70s after Van Halen, who I love, rock n roll embraced technical ability and so we have many great player sin rock field now like Eddie Van Halen, Steve Vai, lots of great pickers these days. A little off track here, which brings me to present. A guy I really admire and wanted to work with is Brad Paisley. A really nice guy and fabulous guitar player. Whats amazing is he could play rock n roll, country - hes one of those artists in between those worlds. If you put a rock band behind him, he wouldnt change a thing and hed be the greatest rock player in the world. I want to grow up and be Brad Paisley.',0),(268,'johnfogerty','What do you think about the song  Fortunate Son  being used on Wrangler Jean ads, where they completely change the meaning of the song (they take out the  it aint me  part)?','Hey Mr. Berger. I was really pissed off the first time I heard it, too! I think my reaction was  Oh my God, they turned my song into pants!  Heres the funny part about all of this. Back in the times I was raised, I didnt want my musical stars to be pitchmen selling products. Especially guys with a conscience - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen. you get the picture. Those guys, myself included, got lots of airplay on the radio. It seemed tawdry to be going after even more money by making commercials. So, here we are in the new millenium. Its much harder for people of my generation, including myself, to get that sort of radio airplay. Its a fact of life, the way the music industry has changed. Some actually believe that the straightest line to getting airplay is to make some sort of commercial with your song in it. Therefore, the new millenium of this brave new world, I have a much more tolerant idea about such things. Oh my god, call me a hypocrite, but I feel the day may come that I will willingly have a commercial with my song in it. By the way, so far, those songs youve heard in commercials have not happened willingly on my part. Stay tuned.',0),(269,'johnfogerty','   I am curious as to whether the songs  Proud Mary  and  Down on the Corner  are based on real-life experiences of yours or someone you know, or were they just made up?','Hmmm. Well in the case of Proud Mary, the song kind of just landed on me. Sometimes it feels that way, as if you had just tuned a radio station in your mind correctly and some music comes through very clearly. Proud Mary was written directly after I had just been honorably discharged from the Army in 1968. It was sitting on the steps to my little apartment and was a surprise when I opened the envelope. I was so happy, at the height of Vietnam, that I turned a cartwheel on the lawn and went inside and 50 minutes later I had written Proud Mary. Boy was I happy. You may call that a real life experience but not sure what it had to do with a river and a boat.  Down on the Corner, believe it or not, was kind of inspired by seeing an advertisement in the paper one day. It was an ad from Disney that said in great big letters  Winnie the Poo.  Something in my brain said  Winnie the Poo and the Poo Boys.  Obviously that was close to  Willy and the Poor Boys.  As I began to develop this idea it turned into music in that weird mystical almost uncontrollable way music comes to songwriters. Winnie the Poo is still my favorite character who Ive shared with my daughter Kelsy since the day she was born, tho shes growing out of it. But Im not.',0),(270,'johnfogerty','If you were to write a  Fortunate Son  for today, what would it be about?','My starting point is actually in the second verse. Its an age old struggle and unfortunately its still with us. Something that probably bothers me more about life in this world and anything else is wealthy, privileged, spoiled rich people have so much power. All you have to do is look at Wall Street and some of the firms, big names on Wall Street, and trace some of the members of those firms directly to the White House. You realize  oh my god, theyre running things, no matter which party gets elected.  This REALLY pisses me off. I hope someday because of the iternet and fact that we can all be so connected, we are able to put a stop to that and have the common man running things. After all, there are so many more of us.',0),(271,'johnfogerty','What was your experience of Woodstock 69? com/watch?','Getting to Woodstock was an experience Ill never forget. As we got closer and closer in a helicopter from the holiday inn where we were staying, you could see cars parked on the highways abandoned for miles. Long skinny parking lots. Everyone left their cars and walked. Ive never seen that again in my life. Once on the ground, I felt a sense of trepidation. I was kinda worried that someone might yell  fire!  in a locked club. I was afraid of the prospect of people stampeding or getting anxious about something. Happily nothing like that happened. Everyone had a great time and I followed the Grateful Dead, who put half a million people to sleep. It was my job to warm them up for Janis.',0),(272,'johnfogerty',' Im a big Fan, and im only 21 Have you ever seen the rain?  Where did that come from?','It was written during a very chaotic time in the life of myself and my band CCR. Literally the song is about the band breaking up. To explain it as clearly as I can, the band seemed to have arrived at a place where we had accomplished all of those amazing goals we had set for ourselves and everything should have been perfect but right at that same time, the guys in the band were voicing louder and louder their dissatisfaction with this thing or that thing, usually tiny things like why cant we each have a separate limo. It seemed to me as if you had a beautiful blue sky, Gods perfection, but at the same time it was raining down all the dissatisfaction. The amazing thing is now, when I look back, this song has a really beautiful melody. I thank God for that. It kind of landed on me. The song has taken on a new and joyful meaning for me. It is because the song reminds me of my daughter Kelsy. As you know, she is also the joy in my life. A rainbow, if you will. My song Have You Ever Seen the Rain does have a rainbow in it.',0),(273,'johnfogerty','Were there any songs you wrote where some of your band members or anyone said, no that wont ever be a success, but turned out to be a huge success?','Well, I will tell one tale out of school, I guess. I remember showing the band the song Down on the Corner. We were in the studio, now remember that song has a lot of tricky rhythmic parts. At some point, Stu Cook was frustrated with playing the bass line and he said something like  Well this isnt good. Its not even rock n roll.  Something like that. As leader of the band, therefore the general that was trying to lead his troops over the hill to victory, there was a large cartoon bubble over my head that said  Didnt come to fight, came to make a record.  I kept my mouth shut to provide support and info to get our job done. I will say in hindsight, besides that singular event, a lot of the time the guys really liked the songs I wrote. This was the general feeling until the band got to that stage where a lot of bands find themselves, where the bickering and silliness from within began to get louder than the job of making music.',0),(274,'johnfogerty','any thoughts of politics?','I have no thoughts about being a politician. Its a thankless job. It seems the only really truthful politicians are done in pretty quickly by their cohorts, the other politicians. It seems to be reelected you have to lie to someone so you will look good to everybody and find yourself agreeing with the largest group of voters. I believe you end up losing yourself because there is so much insincerity. That said, I still go to the polls and vote because thats our privilege, our right and our duty, and Im perennially disappointed.',0),(275,'johnfogerty','Where did CCR get its sound?  What were some of your influences?','The sound of CCR was really a direct result of my musical influences. For instance, I really loved the sound of some of the country artists like Johnny Cash and many of the early Sun Records stars. I think this was probably an influence that wasnt really present in the other guys backgrounds. I also loved blues and R&amp;B, which we all shared, and some of my heroes had a bit of influence on the overall sound that I wanted to project. For instance, Bo Diddley, Carl Perkins, Hank Williams, Wilson Pickett, and of course the influence of Elvis was everywhere in rock n roll. It really hard to make a complete answer out of this question. Like most kids my age, just about anything great that happened in rock n roll I was influence by.',0),(276,'johnfogerty','What do you feel defines America?','Do you mean then? Or now? Thats obviously the answer from an older person with a bit of nostalgia in his heart. I grew up in an America that took great pride in its ability to be the best there was in the world. I feel our citizens still feel that way in their hearts. I do believe we have our talents and our every-man sincerity squandered by our titans and tycoons of business. All you have to say is  China.  Im hoping we will re-discover that pride in workmanship, in service, in an honest days wage for an honest days work, which is the slogan we all used to live by. I do remember a time when a person who was doing a chore for you really tried hard to make the customer be first.  The customer always comes first.  Nowadays, I realize that almost sounds corny. But I really do hope we get back to those values.',0),(277,'johnfogerty',' Whats the best advice you can give on how to enter the industry in 2013?','More power to you! Believe in your dream absolutely. Go for it. Now, in all sincerity, and you may find that strange, but when you come to the point where you have bandmates and you think theyre the guys youre going to battle with in this musical skirmish if you will, try to get the things youve agreed upon in writing. I am serious about this. I had many agreements with my bandmates way back in the day. Unfortunately those agreements were not in writing. I was counting on everybodys word as a gentlemen. Unfortunately people change and they think their word can change to suit later situations. Oh man, am I sorry about that. Ok, after that disclaimer, my advice is to trust your heart, do the sort of music and material/songs you really resonate with. Dont let someone else control or thwart your dream and your vision. Take advice when you can, but be true to yourself.',0),(278,'johnfogerty','  What exactly does  chooglin  mean?','It was just a fun expression that I made up. It wasnt a real word but I wanted to have a word that sounded kind of like  rockin,   shufflin,   boogie,  kind of rock n roll.',0),(279,'johnfogerty','Hi, John - the new album is fantastic! Train of Fools  is just the latest among many excellent songs youve written about trains - have you had a lifelong interest in them, or are you just attracted to the imagery they evoke?','Ive had a lifelong interest in trains. I cant really explain it, but there just seems to be something very American about them. At least, some connection to American history. When I was quite young, I remember I was stopped at a railroad crossing and a train was coming. My dad talked about the trin and said something like  Son, trains like that are disappearing quickly and wont be any more like that.  Talkin about a steam engine from the 1800s. We were in Montana at the time. Must have been an extraordinary train to see with my father. Trains also represent some mystical escape. ',0),(280,'johnfogerty','Hello big fan here, which artist did you enjoy most to cooperate with on your new album?','That answer changes by the minute. When Im listening to Proud Mary, I remember the wonderful day I had with Jennifer and Allen Toussaint and the New Orleans musicians. Almost Saturday Night - great time with dear friend Keith Urban. When I listen to Fortunate Son, remember incredible experience recording and playing live with the Foos. So much fun. Its a matter of who Im thinking about at the time. This album was truly a joyful experience, wonderful learning experience for me, and Im quite certain something Im gonna remember for a long long time.',0),(281,'sundialbill',' What made you chose doing stuff like kid shows as opposed to working solely in a lab?','I worked at an engineering firm (which has since been absorbed) for people obsessed with making a profit every quarter (every 3 months). You cannot advance much with that outlook. So, I decided to affect the future as much as could; I shifted my focus to elementary science education. The objective 20 years ago, and the objective now, is to, dare I say it, change the world. The outcome is still to come I believe as people like you become engineers and captains of industry. Im hoping you all will make the world great.',0),(282,'sundialbill','*  Are there any facts that you said on your show in the 90s that youd take back if you did the show today, since the popular scientific opinion has changed?','No. We did our absolute best to focus on science rather than technology. That way, it stands the test of time, as well as being fascinating. There must be errors. I mean, we did a hundred shows. I sure wish I had been successful in convincing Disney executives to release the Sound Track of Science. I wish I could change  Light Optics  to  Light, Bending &amp; Bouncing.  Id change  Oceanography  to  Ocean Currents.  But all in all, the shows came out okay.',0),(283,'sundialbill','Whats the biggest problem you see science answering in the next decade?','Dont know. inherently unknowable. Science is done by humans; it does not exist without us. There are millions of scientists and engineers working on thousands of aspects of nature all the time. Who knows what will be discovered in the coming decade. Id sure like it if everybody worked together on climate change. Right now, so many worthy scientists are compelled to spend so much good time responding to the political effects caused by climate change denial.',1),(284,'sundialbill','What is your favorite scientific theorem or equation?','Cant say I have a favorite. They are all so important to our understanding of nature and our place in space. With that said, Michael Faraday changed the world. We have electricity and these fancy computer machines as a result. BTW, Darwin discovered so much about how we came to be, and he didnt even know about DNA. Astonishing. Its the process of science that has changed the world. Science rules!',0),(285,'sundialbill',' Nye is there any interesting event from your childhood, teens, or even adult life that you would be willing to share?  If so what is it and how did it affect your life?','I watched bumble bees (Hymentoptera bombidae) for hours. How could such a relatively big animal fly with such relatively small wings? The answer was discovered in my lifetime. Their abdomens are springs, and their halteres provide vortices with allow the wings to swing up with hardly any aerodynamic drag. If I may, how cool is that?',0),(286,'sundialbill','Do you think that we could have a manned mission to Mars in our lifetime with all the factors such as time from Earth to Mars and with the amount of solar radiation that the men would face during the trip?','Were we to discover evidence of something alive on Mars, either fossil or even living now (!! !!), it would change this world forever.

Also, who wrote the parody songs at the end of each episode?','I insisted on  Discipline in Vocabulary  (the D.I.V.) and Show-Then-Tell. For the parodies, we had terrific writers, all of whom have gone on to do great things in television, movies, and public relations. This year is the 20th anniversary of the show.

We rendered them to be work as sundials as well as test patterns for the cameras. Check out planetary.org. ',0),(296,'vonahn','  Also, how do you plan to incorporate languages that are almost impossible to directly translate?   Any comment on this method of teaching and its incorporation into languages that arent necessarily translatable to English?','When we started Duolingo, we didnt know much about how to best teach languages. So we read a bunch of books on how to do it, and we also talked to language acquisition experts, asking them very specific and practical questions. For example, I wanted to know, in Spanish should we teach adjectives before adverbs or adverbs before adjectives. And I was surprised to find out that they actually didnt know the answer! They would say stuff like, Well, the current philosophy is blah blah, but never really get to the point. Nobody could tell me, for a fact, what was better. At first, I was pretty amazed and thought: What the hell are these people good for? But then I realized: Im a computer science professor, and I cant tell you what the *best* way to teach computer science is. I know how I do it and what has worked for me in the past, but thats about it. And in fact, thats basically the current status within most of education: we teach based on very little science.    So, we designed an initial curriculum based on everything we learned through reading books and asking experts. But then we realized something. As Duolingo started growing, we had a unique opportunity. We had millions of users and we could actually find out by ourselves everything we wanted to know. Questions nobody had ever answered before! So this is what we do now. Were basically doing very large-scale data-driven education, and improving it every day. For example, if we want to know how early we should teach plurals, we simply test it. We give a group of 50,000 people plurals a little earlier in the course than everybody else, and we measure: do these people learn faster, do they learn better, do they stick around for longer? And if its better, we start teaching plurals earlier to everybody. This approach improves the experience on Duolingo and also is giving us answers to those language questions we really couldnt find answers to when we were just starting out.  We will likely by adding other ways of learning the language but in all cases well be driven by the data we gather.',0),(297,'vonahn',' What is the long term goal (future) of DL?

Why is there no good API for it?  When can we see Chinese for DL?  Given youre the CEO of DL, how much time do you still have to do  pure  academic research?  Given that at universities only really care about how many papers (and their significance) you publish, do you have some kind of special arrangement with Carnegie Mellon?  What is future plans?  Go full time for DL or become a Full Professor?  Any new revolutionary projects in you head?','&gt; What is the long term goal (future) of DL? How is DL going to try to make money? With just the translations? Are you waiting to be aquired?  Were definitely not waiting to be acquired. Our goal is to really have the best language learning site in the world and at the same time keep it totally free. In order to do that, we need to make enough money from the translations to support our operations, but were pretty confident we can do that.  &gt; Given that DL is free and only wants you to translate web pages: Why is DL not open sourced? Why is there no good API for it?  Open-sourcing something well requires quite a bit of effort (its not just about putting the code out there). Weve considered this, but so far it has never been our top priority. Same goes for the API.  &gt; When can we see Chinese for DL?  As soon as we start allowing people to add their own languages, which will hopefully be some time this year.  &gt; Given youre the CEO of DL, how much time do you still have to do  pure  academic research?  Right now, zero. DL takes up quite a bit of time,  &gt; Given that at universities only really care about how many papers (and their significance) you publish, do you have some kind of special arrangement with Carnegie Mellon? You dont seem to publish too much, many professors would get into trouble.  Ive been very fortunate that CMU has given me the freedom to do whatever I want, which happens to be building things like reCAPTCHA and Duolingo.  &gt; What is future plans? Go full time for DL or become a Full Professor? Any new revolutionary projects in you head?  I want to finish watching Gossip Girl.',0),(298,'vonahn','Are there any new languages planned for Duolingo coming up?','Adding new languages is a difficult and time consuming task. We have a small team, and weve realized well never be able to add all the languages we want as fast as we want. That said, we get a lot of emails from people who really like our cause, are interested in learning Dutch, Swedish, Turkish (you name it!), and want to help us add more languages. So thats the approach we plan to take: Instead of us slowly adding languages, well create all the tools necessary for the community to build them. This means we can introduce more languages and empower other experts and people passionate about a specific language to lead the way.  We dont yet have a date for when this will go live, but its on the roadmap.',0),(299,'vonahn',' How can you convince me that Duolingo is better?  In other words, what does Duolingo have that Rosetta Stone doesnt?','First, Duolingo is totally free. No ads, no subscriptions, no 5-easy-payments plan. Rosetta Stone costs hundreds of dollars.  Second, there is scientific evidence that Duolingo can be more effective. An independent study was done by a research team that previously evaluated the effectiveness of Rosetta Stone. They found that it takes students on Duolingo 34 hours to learn the equivalent of a one-semester university course, whereas it takes 55 hours with Rosetta Stone. Here is a link to the study: http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf  And of course there are other differences that are harder to quantify: Duolingo has game mechanics, a 5-star mobile app, and since it doesnt come in a CD-ROM, were able to improve it on a daily basis.',0),(300,'vonahn','What inspired you to start duolingo?   Which languages will be added in the future?    Are there any new features planned?','About three years ago, I was in a very fortunate position in my life. I had just sold my second company to Google, and I didnt need to work anymore. Something that Id always wanted to work on was education. Im a professor and its a passion of mine, so I wanted to do something related to it. But see, my view was also colored by where Im from. I was born and raised in Guatemala, which is a very poor country. So I wanted to make a system to provide free top-notch education to anybody, regardless of whether they can afford it.',0),(301,'vonahn','&gt; crappy language learning software  What exactly are the reasons that you find most language learning software deficient, and how does DuoLingo make up for these shortcomings?','Because they dont motivate you to keep going!

It would be much easier to sneak a session or two in at work, or use it while the kids are watching tv.  Its there! Go to the settings :)  &gt; 2) Some of the lessons should have  cheat sheets , like  Prepositions . Thats difficult to learn via osmosis, or just guessing at the translations; and for visual learners its really hard to get them straight without seeing all the options.

Their major issues are the inability to adjust to the changing market. They did great when Facebook gaming was on the rise, but now its declining and Mobile is on the rise. Theyre trying to change over, but employ too many of the same game development  best practices  that were developed for Facebook games. These just dont translate to the mobile market, which is why theyre suffering in that market.   Theres also lots of other issues internally.   A lot of micro-management from the top down that stifles the creativity and hinders the production of many games.   An over reliance on every game being a blockbuster hit which makes the fun aspect of games suffer while making the money grabbing tactics all too transparent to the users.  And a serious lack of foresight over all. Too many major decisions are quick reactions to sudden changes in the market. If some games jumps to the top of the Top Grossing charts then everyone need to drop everything and change to follow it. Which wastes time, makes for bad design and ultimately puts projects behind schedule. It just means theyre always late to the party, and whatever game theyre trying to compete with has already faded away by the time their own version hits the market.   They rely too much on reacting to what is making money now, and too much on their own data. They dont strive to make anything new or innovative and thats no way to excel in the games market. You need to lead the pack, not try emulate the best practices of top games with the hopes that you can out perform and already established IP.',0),(413,'former_zyngite','+ With regards to developments in Zynga performance and stock price, how did employee perception of the situation change during those periods of time ?  + What was the culture and expectation like initially, did it then evolve ?','I started just as the company was going public. At the time everyone was REALLY excited. For people who had been there for a long time, it meant that a lot of the bonuses they had been accruing would finally pay off. The rest of us were happy to be a part of a company that was gonna hit big and we were on the ground floor. All that quickly dissipated after the stock plummeted from $15 to $8 by the first selling window. Now the stock has lingered around $3 for 8 months. Its kind of a joke. Everyone kinda hopes it will go up, but at the same time everyone knows theres no guarantee.   As for the copying, I feel Ive touched on that in other comments. But if you have specific additional questions, let me know.  The culture was.weird. At least for me. Ive never been a corporate kind of person. So it was hard to adjust. One of the weirder things was the obsession with dogs.  I like dogs. Theyre great. I grew up with them. Never really wanted to take one to work. But its highly encouraged there. And kind of obsessed over. Some of the dogs were cool. Some were barking assholes I wanted to punch in the face. Its kind of like a crying baby on an airplane. It sucks, and theres nothing you can do about it.   Beyond all that, the culture had a major dichotomy. There were the people that saw through the bullshit and were there to get a paycheck and take advantage of what was offered. And there were those who loved the company and everything they did and truly believed in the company mission and every game that launched. From my perspective, more people that made the games were in the cynical camp, and more people that worked in the support groups (HR, legal, etc) were in the spirit squads. But thats not a hard rule.',0),(414,'former_zyngite','I never played any of their games because I could see everything was a clone or designed to make me buy stuff. Was there anything the staff felt was actually worth playing?','Oh yeah. I mean a lot of the people there genuinely loved the games. I was never really a fan either, but there were some that I played.   I think that a lot of freemium games suffer from the obvious fact that theyre asking for money. But thats what you get from a free game, right? I mean Zynga wasnt making games to be charitable. Its a business. So the games they provided were free, and most people never paid. And for them that was fine.   I think a lot of gamers look at that with disdain because they hate the idea of paying to win. It takes the sport out of the game and makes it unfair. If I could pay $1 and win a deathmatch round of Halo Id be a cheating asshole. But thats because everyone playing Halo already dropped $60 to play that game and its also just not fair.   The playing field for freemium games is different. Farmville isnt a deathmatch. Its a solo grind that requires players to spend time and spam their friends to advance. If you dont want to do either, you can spend a dollar. The general attitude with freemium is that if youre going to pay us, well let you skip through the game as fast as you want. Because, who cares? We get the money, and you get to save some time. We both win.   Im not saying its for everyone. But theres clearly a market for this kinda gaming. ',0),(415,'former_zyngite',' Do you know anything about that?','Yeah, they want to get into real money gambling. Heres the issues.  Its been legal in other countries for years. The companies that have been working those markets were the ones to pioneer and legitimize those markets.   Zynga is hopping in late. They have launched RMG (real money gambling) in the countries where its currently legal, but theyre not the first to the market.  They are pushing the legislation to make it legal in the US. But if it passes, there are other companies who have been doing it longer and better than zynga who will jump on the US market first. Zynga might jump on at the same time, but who are you going to trust your real money with? The company that has been managing online casinos for a decade or the company that is trying to jump into it now?   I dont blame Zynga for going after this market, and I honestly believed this could be the saving grace for Zynga. But they are Johnny-come-lately to this market.   In theory, they might be able to make tons of money on RMG. But in reality, there are a dozen other companies that have been doing it longer and better. ',0),(416,'former_zyngite','Just how prolific is their theft of other games?','Thats a broad question. But it varies. They got a lot better recently. After The Ville got sued by EA it was much less okay to  fast follow  a game (The term for copying a game).   I think that early on it was blatant. Later it became well known practice at Zynga, but rather poor taste. Dream Heights/Tiny Tower was a big slap in the face. Sims Social/The Ville was the last straw. Towards the end of my time it was not so much that games were straight up ripped off, but key features would be. Such as the general method or menu flow that a game handles its multiplayer. The idea being that if it works for that game, it would work for our game.  In general though, most of us knew what game was copying what. Bubble Safari was a copy of Bubble Witch Saga. The Ville was Sims Social. Hidden Chronicles was Gardens of Time. The company didnt call it out for what it was, but you knew because whatever project you were on most likely had similar pressures to match and beat a game on the market. ',0),(417,'former_zyngite','  If there are any, were there any games that looked great on paper and you thought  was going to be great, but in reality didnt work?   Any games you thought was going to be a succes, but got scraped?','Youre welcome, and thank you!  Yes. Honestly most of the games look great on paper. But thats kinda true of every game ever. Ideas are great. But once you play it, sometimes its not actually as great as it seems.   There was one in mobile that was a dragonvale style game. You bred dragons. But it also had an angry birds component. You used the dragons to fire different kinds of fireballs at pirate ships that were encroaching on your territory. In theory it seemed great. Sounded totally fun. In reality it was kind of a Frankenstein of both games and neither part worked because  both aspects were tacked on by the executive staff late in the dev cycle.   There always seemed to be a lot of games like that. They were 70% awesome. They just needed a little push to make them great. But the teams werent left alone to make the final adjustments. Someone up top would always feel like they knew what had to be done. So some major (and often uninformed) changes were pushed on the team and they would be forced to change features that would ultimately disrupt the rest of the game and cause the entire project to fail. ',0),(418,'former_zyngite','What (if anything) do you think they did right as a company?','They really try hard to keep morale high. They give so many perks that you really get accustomed to it. I ate two out of three meals for free at work every day. It was awesome. And they provided healthy options! They promoted volunteering. Going green. They really tried hard to be a good place to work and a socially conscious company. In that way, theyre really great.   On the games side of things I think their whole concept of pulling data on everything players do is amazing. However their over reliance on that is not so amazing. It made the development very analytical, and less intuitive. Its easy to tell when a game is fun. Its hard to pull data on that though.',0),(419,'former_zyngite','Tell us about the highs and lows of departmental competition would you?  Wasnt it encouraged by zynga?','It wasnt necessarily encouraged. It wasnt like the midcore division was trying to out perform the casual gaming division.   But ultimately you wanted to make a game that went live and made tons of money. If you did you got all the best perks.   There were things that were available to everyone in the company, like the gym and free food. But if you were on a top grossing team then you got additional perks, like trips to Vegas and other off-site excursions.   The problem being that some games inherently had better opportunities for success. Farmville 2 was destined to succeed as it had all the best of the best working on it and every spare dollar thrown at it. Smaller games had to perform at the same level with fewer resources and a smaller time frame.   There was always the chance that your small game could blow up and be huge. But odds were that if you were on a Farmville or Poker game, you were going to do much better than someone on an unproven new IP. ',0),(420,'former_zyngite','Do you know any dirty secrets or scandals about the company ?','Nothing that probably hasnt already been reported. I think the worst during my time was the law suit against the c-staff for insider knowledge. When the company went public the shares were $10. At their peak they were $15 and the c-staff had a special clause that allowed them to sell early. They sold something like 15 or 20% of their shares when the stocks were at their highest. By the time employees could sell for the first time it had dropped to $8 a share. After that window closed, the stock price had dropped to $4 or $5  by the next time employees could sell. I guess the investors were pissed that the top brass made out like bandits and everyone else got screwed. ',0),(421,'former_zyngite','General business practice to not  reinvent the wheel , however do you think it was a bad business move to actually make the idea taking so noticable?   How much rework is done on a video game besides just the remaining of the game?','If I understand you correctly, youre asking how much more work is done beyond just copying a game?   It always sounds so simple. Like youre just going to copy a game the same way youd throw a document on a Xerox machine and press a button. Its not that simple. Maybe a few games were that obviously blatant, but most werent. There were a lot of aspects that were reused. Maybe the layout of a menu. The general design of a feature (or core loop of a game). But for the most part, everything was still made from scratch.  If the games were just straight up copies, it would be a lot easier. But no one on the teams actually wants to do that. So they try to make the content as original as possible. So the game takes as long to make as any other game would. ',0),(422,'former_zyngite','What kind of snacks were in the break room?','Depends on the room, but the basics were granola bars, cookies, liquorish bites, kettle chips, pop chips, pretzel bites, hard boiled eggs, cereal, nuts, chex mix, coffee and tea.',0),(423,'former_zyngite','Was buying Draw-Something really worth it for Zynga?','No. It was a major financial fuck up.   Whether or not people stopped playing because Zynga bought OMGPop was minimal.  The problem was that they paid top dollar for a game/studio that had already hit their peak. At the time Zynga was on top of the world and had money to burn. They burned that money on a studio/game that held huge potential and didnt pan out. Its no fault of OMGPop. They cashed out at the best time possible. But Zynga had a tendency to buy better games than they could make.   Zynga bought Words with Friends and Draw Something. I challenge you to name a game that they made that did better and is better known. Theres one game that did better, but those two are the best known games and both were shitty money makers.

',0),(425,'former_zyngite','How do you feel about the revolving door mentality for employees working in a lot of development studios (basically as soon as the game gets done there is a mass layoff)?','Its the worst aspect of working in the industry, easily. Its an unstable industry and you have to accept that youre going to lose your job, and change companies multiple times throughout your career.  Some people in normal industries can get a job, work there for 40 years and retire. Thats virtually impossible in the games industry. ',0),(426,'former_zyngite',' What do you think?  Would you like to continue in the social gaming industry or youd prefer to take your creative talents elsewhere?','Well Zyngas major focus now is Mobile. Theyre just not making a great transition into it. Theyre great at Facebook games, but its just not the same thing.  I wouldnt mind staying in social gaming. I started in consoles. One thing I really miss is having a physical copy of the product Ive helped to create. Its nice being able to grab someones iPhone and direct them to the game youve made and make them download it for free. But when that game gets cancelled, it no longer exists. ANYWHERE. Thats pretty depressing.   I honestly dont care where I work, as long as I enjoy what Im doing and feel passionate about what Im making. Mobile.console.As long as someone out there enjoys what Im creating, Im happy.',0),(427,'former_zyngite','What are the benefits of working at Zynga?','Lots of perks, like a gym in the building, three free meals a day, happy hour every Friday with free booze, unlimited vacation days. Not everyone takes advantage of them all. I loved getting a free 15 minute massage once a week. ',0),(428,'former_zyngite','Did you have a feeling previously that you were going to be laid off?  Are they providing you benefits to help find another job?','I had no idea this was coming. Totally out of the blue. I knew things werent great at the company but I wasnt expecting layoffs at this point and I wasnt expecting to be part of it if it did happen. I did get a nice severance package and benefits. So Im pretty well set for a while and I have a lot of friends and former co-workers in other parts of the industry. So Ive got a lot of leads already.',0),(429,'former_zyngite','What percent of users actually pay real money in Zynga games?','Depends on the game, but on average I think its about 5%. Maybe less. ',0),(430,'former_zyngite','Are the top brass really as big of assholes as they seem?','In general, theyre all fairly good guys. However I think theres a lot of the old c-staff that came to Zynga for the money. Theyre guys who made a name in the industry working on big games, saw an opportunity to make some big bucks in a new market, hopped in, cashed out and took off. The guys that are still around are doing what they can, but its kind of like trying to sail a sinking ship. Everyone has ideas on how to change things, and each new change makes more problems. ',0),(431,'former_zyngite','Did they offer separation package?','Yep. I cant say for sure that everyone got what I did. But I got four months salary plus an additional week for each partial year. I worked almost two years, so I got 4.5 months paid. Plus insurance is paid on top of that. ',0),(432,'former_zyngite','Why do you think you were one of the laid-off people?  Was it random or were you involved in a failed or not-so-successful project?','For me I know that I was low-man on the totem pole. I was a valuable and well like person in my team. My boss is actively attempting to find me a new job. But the fact is that the few people on my team were crucial to continued development, where as I was a support aspect to the team.',0),(433,'former_zyngite','How much longer will Zynga be around for?','Hard to say. At this rate, Id give them another 2 to 3 years. They make money and have a lot in the bank. But they also throw away money like you wouldnt believe.  If they actually manage to change their strategy and start putting out some big hits, they could be around a lot longer.',0),(434,'former_zyngite','What are your plans for finding a new job?  Will you work in the same industry considering the plummeting job market?','Im currently taking some time to consider all my options. The industry is rough. Theres always that looming threat of getting laid off. And it sucks. I know theres no guarantee in any job. But Im considering looking to other industries where my skills would be applicable. But if I get offered a great game industries job, I wouldnt turn it down. Its still a fun and exciting industry. The stability is just crap. ',0),(435,'former_zyngite','Do you think theyll get into the real-money online poker market?','Commented on this in other replies. But yes, they could if they were first to market. The problem being that other companies have been into Real Money Gambling in other countries for much longer than Zynga. And  so its unlikely for them to be the victors when RMG hits the US.',0),(436,'former_zyngite','have you ever heard of zynga going after a company for copying one of their games?','Not off the top of my head, but any game that tried to go live with the  XVille  kind of name got hit by the legal team.

Theyre still constrained, but are pushing back against the secrecy that shrouds the program:  This morning we sent the following letter to the offices of the Attorney General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Read the full text below. -Ed.  Dear Attorney General Holder and Director Mueller  Google has worked tremendously hard over the past fifteen years to earn our users trust. For example, we offer encryption across our services; we have hired some of the best security engineers in the world; and we have consistently pushed back on overly broad government requests for our users data.   We have always made clear that we comply with valid legal requests. And last week, the Director of National Intelligence acknowledged that service providers have received Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests.   Assertions in the press that our compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered access to our users data are simply untrue. However, government nondisclosure obligations regarding the number of FISA national security requests that Google receives, as well as the number of accounts covered by those requests, fuel that speculation.  We therefore ask you to help make it possible for Google to publish in our Transparency Report aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosuresin terms of both the number we receive and their scope. Googles numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made. Google has nothing to hide.   Google appreciates that you authorized the recent disclosure of general numbers for national security letters. There have been no adverse consequences arising from their publication, and in fact more companies are receiving your approval to do so as a result of Googles initiative. Transparency here will likewise serve the public interest without harming national security.  We will be making this letter public and await your response.

Weve had a number of elected officials speak out in support of investigations and accountability, and a substantial minority of elected officials have been voting against Patriot Act and FISA Amendments Act reauthorization in recent years -- some specifically because of their concerns about these programs.

Do you think that producing the new season as a prequel to the movie took away from its potential?  Who is your favorite non-Bluth character?  What can you tell us about the movie?  Whered the lighter fluid come from?','*What is your favorite line ever from the show?*  Thats REALLY hard because there are really clever lines, there are lines that are delivered really well - sometimes the less clever stuff thats delivered by these genius actors well becomes my favorite line. Right now, one of my favorite lines is when George Sr introduces Buster in episode 6 and hes in the Winnebago and George says  As you see, my sons in the Army, Buster say hello  and Buster says  hmm.    *Do you think that producing the new season as a prequel to the movie took away from its potential?*  Im going to try to interpret that question because it could mean a couple things. One version of that question is  Do I think it will hurt the chances that the movie will get made  - and I would say that Im more interested in telling the ongoing saga of this family than working out a particular strategy for how to do it. I kind of feel like the form will emerge in a way that I wouldnt have anticipated - like Netflix a few years ago - so its possible that a film studio says  Theres a lot of AD out there. Do we want to invest in more  or its possible that a film studio says  Wow, we had no idea there was this kind of a following.  And I think the latter scenario is possible. Just because I didnt think there was that kind of a following! But if your question is  Does the story weve told detract from a movie , I would say it definitely doesnt, or wasnt intended to - it was intended to set up (among other things) a murder-mystery and a family that really now has to come together to save one of their own at a moment when their tensions are the highest.   *Who is your favorite non-Bluth character?*  My favorite non-Bluth characters are the 3 guys in the 1920s Mexican film where we saw the origin of the Chicken Dance. Their names are Gustavo, Enrique, and Paco (*whose name is also actually Gustavo). And they were played by Jason, Will and Tony.  *What can you tell us about the movie?*  Another ambiguous question! Well what were calling the movie is just the ongoing story - so at the moment, there is nothing really up with it, except that I am gathering up ammunition to try to get the next chapter made.  *Whered the lighter fluid come from?*  Gob and most magicians start their day by strapping a number of implements and bladders to their body. They write playing cards on their arms, they tape magnets to their legs, they run hoses down their sleeves, and they attach small flints to their fingers. This is one of the hilarious things about magicians. Spoiler alert: theres no such thing as magic. So the lighter fluid comes from a small bladder that is squeezed by his left arm. Dont tell.',0),(449,'MitchHurwitz',' My question is regarding your methodology  how in the hell did you keep all of these storylines straight during the writing process?  On February 11, 2006 What were your thoughts of continuing the Bluth story?  Did you think you had a shot in hell at ever telling more?','It was one of the bigger challenges, and this woman Joey Slamon who was a co-producer on the show turned out to be really gifted at keeping track of that stuff while I was straining to do the same. But mostly, it was all worked out in advance as best as possible and then the holes were patched in post and there was some re-shooting. And I think it would have been much easier if we had shot in sequence, but youre right, it did require a lot of thinking (for example)  Wait a minute. If Tobias has already been to the clinic, and Gob doesnt pick up deBrie until after the clinic, then theres no way Lindsay would be wearing the red wig at the dinner yet.  It was constantly stopping and thinking REALLY hard.   But the bigger answer is that its not really anything other than hard work, and stopping and trying to be really present at every moment of the production.   On February 11, I DID. Theres an audacity that comes with any creative enterprise. I mean, I dont think I would have written my first spec script if I had known how unlikely it was to get a writing job. And I dont think I would have tried creating ARRESTED if I really thought  look at the data of whats already been developed. they wont make this.  but I should have - that was the evidence that existed. I dont think I would have included all the stuff about Saddam Hussein in Season 1 if Id done the math on the likelihood of getting through an entire season to reveal the punchline. And I think that everyone has to jump off that cliff and make that assumption in their own work - because the truth is, even if it doesnt happen, you have a more interesting life if youre to sit down and write a novel than doing the math on the likelihood of it getting published. ',0),(450,'MitchHurwitz','I am wondering if there was any inspiration in real life that led to the idea of Tobias being a Never Nude?','No, there wasnt. The Never Nude thing - I will trace the etiology of that idea, and its this. We had this joke that just put us out, that was Tobias keeps crying in the shower. And then I had pitched - I was thinking about production, and the way they shoot those things, they always put people in flesh colored bathing suits, and I said, what if we show part of the flesh colored bathing suits for 3-4 weeks - and then in the 4th week we reveal that he showers in a flesh-colored bathing suit because he doesnt like showering naked. And then Richie Rosenstock (whos an absolutely brilliant, hilarious guy - and is responsible for so many of the giant laughs in the show) said without hesitation:  Oh, hes a Never Nude.   And everybody in the room froze. And looked at him, and said,  is that a real thing?  and he shrugged, and it was just so funny. It wasnt a funny idea until Richie called him a Never Nude, which took the joke from being just a sight gag, to a psychological affliction that really elevated it in such a brilliant way.  And then I remember looking up to see online if there was such a thing as a Never Nude - and guess what you cant search for besides finding pornography?  Never Nude  - back then youd get 25,000 pages with the word  Nude  in it. Even if you used the Boolean quotation marks, you would still get things like  Hot 18 year old whod NEVER been NUDE in front of a boy!  So well never know if it was a thing before ARRESTED. Although I suppose I could just ask Richie.',0),(451,'MitchHurwitz','Great show, love season 4! Question: Whats your writing process?','It depends on the assignment, and it depends on the challenge in front of me. I personally have no testable, repeatable writing process. Its very strange. Sometimes I type, sometimes I write longhand, sometimes I think, sometimes I dictate, sometimes I just call things out on the set. Ill write scripts in the room, Ill perhaps sit at the keyboard and the script is up on the computer, and ive printed out the outlines and working through it, and soliciting help and questions as we go along - so it becomes a very democratic process. I used to do a pass again (to clarify it and trim it) - on this last show, I had to do a lot of that on the set, which was really a hardship for the actors but made it also really fun and fresh, because wed find the stuff right there.  But if Im writing a pilot, its a whole different process. Its very solitary. So my process is inconsistent. And I try to keep it flexible. I think all of being creative is about being flexible, and not getting into any fixed ideas. Id watch (as I came up) how the writers room worked - it would be 6 people pitching on a variation of  Were not open all night  and one person saying  What if a car drives through the front of the building  - its really trying to stay flexible and not get trapped into one way of thinking. Thats why Buster losing his arm is such an interesting example - I was pitching it as a bad example, not letting myself think that way for a series, and then re-examining that premise and that idea. ',0),(452,'MitchHurwitz','If you could be any Bluth, which would you be?  And which would you definitely not want to be?','  I think I would not want to be Mark - I always wanted there to be a 5th Bluth sibling that didnt give his permission to be in the show. And it was an ambition that I had from the very start. And I realized during the pilot that Id blown it, because all the family pictures should have 5 people in them with one blurred. This was the joke that I ended up doing with Andy Richter. The joke was going to be that his name was Mark - in one version of the joke, the reason that he didnt want to be on the show was because he had a giant red wine birthmark all over his face - and suddenly it didnt seem as noble that he didnt want to be in the show. But it was very clear that I missed that opportunity early on.   Who would I want to be? I guess Id want to be Tobias, because hes the most oblivious and the happiest. And hes the dreamer. And he doesnt know how unrealistic his dreams are, so hes happy. ',0),(453,'MitchHurwitz','How often did you go over the set and writing to make sure all the subtle running gags and references were in there?','Constantly. This is probably a question about the first 3 seasons, I had a monitor in the writers room that would show what was going on onstage and a producer on set that I could call back and forth, and I was just constantly running over there, at least twice in each scene that was shot. Once to get it set up, and then once to show up toward the end and pick up the pieces we didnt get.  The blue handprints, for instance, were CONSTANTLY painted over by the set crew - and I would have to make new ones, and we would have to re-shoot, so it would take effort to create a consistent world.   Thanks for the words - what i was experimenting with then was the idea of putting things in the show that had no apparent payoff until later, and at that time, it was very difficult to get that kind of stuff in, because i was doing the show for the network and there was a notes process and people would say  you can cut this,  and  this slows us down,  and things like that, but it was kind of an experiment and Im glad it worked.',0),(454,'MitchHurwitz',' Hurwitz, How have internet communities(Reddit, Twitter, etc) changed the way TV is enjoyed or discussed?  Has it impacted your end of things(writing, creating, pitching)?','I think its going to have a big impact. I think its going to allow the more creative ideas and the more innovative people and the more ambitious people to have a place to experiment without the burden of having to hit a 20 million person audience on the first night. And one of the burdens that network television implicitly has - theyre not allowed to just respect the cleverest in their audience, they have to please everyone. And I think the Netflix model makes it a little more like publishing - there are different books for different people, and still within that world there are top 10 books that are blockbusters, and then theres fiction thats not for everybody.  In an interview recently, someone asked me  Hey, what did you think of that New York Times review?  A guy at the NY Times watched 5 shows at 3 in the morning and then said  I dont like this  on day 1 - it was a bad way to start. And I dont blame him - try watching something in the middle of the night and see how you like it, especially if it means skipping brunch with your daughter on Memorial Day weekend. And in response, I said -  It sounds like he really didnt like it. But you know who did like it?  And the interviewer said  Who?  And I said  People who really liked it!  (which is true - its NOT for him, its for them!)',0),(455,'MitchHurwitz','Is there any joke that nobody seemed to get that you found hilarious?','Heres the thing: I dont know what nobody seems to get. I mean, sometimes I think that nobody has noticed something, and then Ill hear that someone does. My older brother was over yesterday, and he was pointing out all these really subtle things that I didnt think anybody would  notice. And some of the stuff may be well-known now - my favorite joke is who the real George Maharis is - because thats a punchline we didnt finish. Basically the joke is, he doesnt want to be George Michael, because George Michael had sex in a public mens room, and he doesnt want to be Boy George, because Boy George had sex in a public mens room, so he settles on the name George Maharis. but a little research will show that name has a similar fate. That being said, I think the groupthink on reddit has caught all the jokes that weve layered in - except for the ones we havent finished yet, which are setting up for a future story.',0),(456,'MitchHurwitz',' I just wanted to ask you what was the motive for creating Arrested Development?','There are many answers to that question! But if the question is, what the inspiration was - Ron Howard came to me with the idea of doing a documentary-style show, or maybe David Nevins came to me with an idea - and then when I got into the creative part of it, a lot of it is based on families Ive known, my own family at times, and a lot of it was based on what was going on in the world at that time. But ultimately (and like everything in the show, it was a process of layering) - I think William Faulkner claims that he saw the book THE SOUND AND THE FURY as a lightning bolt that illuminated a landscape and showed him the whole story - this was nothing like that. I think most writers just keep layering and building, and I started with the idea of a set of twins, and one was conservative, and one was liberal. And that gave birth to the idea of the children of those twins, where one was fearless and one was fearful. And then a MILLION other things happened. And those ideas are just so deep down in the pile that theyre almost unrecognizable.

I didnt hear it in the mix we had, but on Netflix, it IS clear for some reason. All the music feels a little bit louder. You assume that 10-20% of the sound gets knocked down, so we make the music a little hotter because it gets cut on broadcast. But I have the feeling he did it on purpose.  For the 5th season, it would DEFINITELY be about the family all together. That was always the design. The idea was originally to have them even together LESS for Season 4 - it really was going to be basically 9 stories (like the Salinger collection) that had nothing to do with one another, and just showed everybodys life, so that everybodys life could get to a point of peril, and then the family could truly have no choice but to get back together for the next iteration.

Because every time I think of something thats too outlandish, I end up trying to find a way to use it.

',0),(460,'MitchHurwitz','Who decided that  a piece of shoe  was the best prop/choice for George Srs Yamaka?','Well, heres what I will say generally about that - Tambor is such a consummate actor, that one of the things I wanted to do in that first season was give him no warddrobe to change, to give him no props to hold (other than a cup of coffee) - he doesnt get to go anywhere, and even the furniture is nailed down. I liked the idea of him being in prison, because he could use no comedic tools besides what he has - it was like a Masters acting class.  We later came up with Oscar (which gave him a LOT to play with) but this season, i wanted to even want to limit that by making them dress alike, have the same haircut - Tambor is like a racehorse, I wanted to see what he could do.    So when it came time to make a yarmulke, all we had left ourselves to make it out of was his shoe.',0),(461,'MitchHurwitz','Was Ann Veal named after an anvil?','Yea, there were a lot of things that her name was made out of - Anvil was definitely part of it. The image of a veal padding pen. And theres an old Monty Python skit where John Cleeses characters name is  An Elk  - it was an oblique reference to that too. Her original name was  Fugly.  We were going to name her something Fugly - and then it felt a little too jokey and they fortunately didnt allow us to say it.',0),(462,'MitchHurwitz','Why was Tobias lying in the fireplace in a couple episodes?','There has been more theorizing about that online - Im amazed that question got through, because Ive seen questions about this for YEARS. David Cross has been approached about it for years, and heres the unfortunate answer; it was a joke that didnt work. I walked onto the set, and there was nothing funny happening in the scene, so I said,  Hey, what if David is leaning back into the fireplace relaxing?  and then when I went into the penthouse in another scene, David had decided to do it again. And people constantly write  I dont get it!  (and unfortunately they DO get it - its a man in a fireplace!)',0),(463,'MitchHurwitz',' I was wondering how much creative freedom did Netflix give you guys?  Were they pretty generous?','100%. Netflix was amazing. Ive become very close to the people over there, and they are all really funny, so if they did have suggestions, they were generally pretty funny, great ones - particularly Ted Sarandos, who runs content for them. And they loved the ambition of the show, and encouraged it.  If you look at the transition from radio to television, the first 15-20 years were basically just radio shows on TV. I didnt want to just do a series on Netflix, I wanted to see what the form would allow. And they dug that idea. ',0),(464,'MitchHurwitz','What do all the ostrich references in season 4 symbolize?','There are a few things going on there, and I never think its appropriate for an author to comment on the symbolism in his work. But one of the things I liked, truly on a superficial level, is that its a truly funny bird. Its a mean chicken the size of a man, and its an ungainly creature that cant seem to gain flight. So theres a lot in there.',0),(465,'MitchHurwitz','Hi, Mr. Hurwitz  I want to download/buy the song  Getaway  by Mark Cherry to use it as a ringtone, how can I have it?','We are really working on it, actually! Its tricky because 20th doesnt really have a record label, which a lot of the other studios do, so they dont have a mechanism in place, but all of Davids music is so great and I really want to get it out there. ',0),(466,'MitchHurwitz','What does your chicken dance look like?','Like this.  ( HURWITZ DOES CHICKEN DANCE )',0),(467,'MitchHurwitz','Will we ever meet the last of the richter quintuplets?  Chareth: The Flirt?','Right now, Chareth is in a Turkish prison, and we havent even been able to get the actor out to shoot his stuff. wait, well now that you mention it, YES, Im ashamed we didnt get him into this series. All I can say is, Andy Richter *does* have to be back in Burbank by 2 PM every day. So it makes it tough to get all Richter Quintuplets on the set. ',0),(468,'MitchHurwitz','There are hints that Tobias is actually a black albino. Was that ever going to be a full storyline?','Im going to second /u/uzumymus comment - that if I did want to do that, revealing that now would be ruining the joke. So perhaps you can think of another joke I can ruin for you that I can feel less bad about. ',0),(469,'MitchHurwitz','My name is Chickens_dont_clap and I approve this AMA! Why did you cut off right when we were about to see George Michaels chicken dance in Season 4?','I dont know - it just seemed funnier! Its almost like negative space in art. Or a rest in music. Sometimes its funnier to have the moment occur, and sometimes its funnier to not have the moment occur, and in that moment it felt like it would be funnier to NOT see it.  Also (*and this could just be personal preference), I saw his Chicken Dance, and chickens dont do that. ',0),(470,'MitchHurwitz','Do your children know to always leave a note?','Ive had other object lessons that Ive worked hard to teach them. Fortunately, I have a friend who strangles small animals and Ive been able to use him successfully to remind them to wear their retainers, etc. ',0),(471,'MitchHurwitz','How satisfying is it to see so many of the actors from AD popping up in  Archer?   Was that amount of overlap acknowledged in the running gag about the Bluths not tipping black men, even on a train?','I love ARCHER and dont know the particular thread youre talking about, so no there is no overlap intended. but lets go ahead and say YES. We completely intended that overlap. ',0),(472,'MitchHurwitz','Who came up with the name Crindy?  Was it legit or just a troll?','My recollection is that I came up with Crindy and that i did it on the set. The problem with writing in a room is attribution becomes very challenging to trace. You know, ideas build on one another, the idea of Gob not knowing his brides name is integral to even getting to the idea of Crindy, and several people often think that theyve thought of the same joke. So most professionals try to resist crediting something to one writer or another unless its really just a clear, precise, moment in the writers room. But theres kind of an acceptance of the idea that were all in this together. ',0),(473,'MitchHurwitz',' Is there any truth to that theory?','The thing about ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is Ive always liked the idea that nothing is as it seems on the outside. So since it seems to you that she might be a man, then its very possible shes actually a woman. ',0),(474,'MitchHurwitz','Who is a guest star you wanted but couldnt get?','I spent a little while trying to get Howard Stern for something. I did want to get Jerry Bruckheimer, and he was too busy.  I did want to get Maria Bamford even before we started. I knew that we needed to get her, and I was willing to move the whole shoot to accommodate that. ',0),(475,'MitchHurwitz','What is your favorite ~~magic trick~~ illusion that Gob attempts?','I think I like the one where he has the Queen of Hearts written on his chest, because I had to work so hard to hide the punchline (which was that it ended up on Michaels shirt). And because it was wrong.',0),(476,'MitchHurwitz','Where can I buy a Cornballer?','I actually saw something online the other day that looked like a Cornballer - ours was made out of a deep-fryer and parts of an aquarium. ',0),(477,'MitchHurwitz','Mr. Hurwitz, can I please work at the banana stand?','There is one on Balboa Island, I think theyre hiring. And you can say that Ive thoroughly vetted you and think you would be an ideal candidate, if that helps.',0),(478,'MitchHurwitz',' Maybe I missed it but how did Lucille Two fall down the staircase?  Was it her vertigo or did someone really push her?','Thats one of the abiding mysteries that Film Studios (or Netflix) will have to find valuable enough to discover to fund more of the show. And whats YOUR theory? Im truly curious. ',0),(479,'MitchHurwitz','where can i buy two children?','Haha!',0),(480,'xombieCHRIST','  Ill just group all of my initial questions together:  - While Im guessing the Terry Garvin name was sort of coincidental (since it was your real first name and you looked a lot like Jimmy Garvin back then), was that foppish  Beauty  gimmick something you got because of the name and the original Terry Garvins reputation?   - How soon after the WWF sexual harrassment scandals broke did you decide to start using your real name?   Did being  pro wrestler Terry Garvin  on TV cause you any  real life  problems until the change?   - Who trained you?   Who else was breaking in at the same time?   - Who came up with The Beautys custom pink mat?   Was there any ill will towards Fritz for giving him a gun the day he killed himself given all of the circumstances surrounding what happened?','1. terry garvin character was simply a play on looking like jimmy garvin who was hot at the time. I didnt even know that there was a terry garvin it wasnt until later that  I found out that he worked for the wwf and worked with pat Patterson. I had an opportunity to speak with terry garvin on several occasions and he was always nice to me and I think somewhat flattered that I was using the pink mat, a gimmick he used years before, honestly I had no clue that it was a total rip off, I could see if he would have been mad for me stealing it.  2. I was working against eddie gilbert and was a fan favorite, I expressed the wish to change to my original name to separate my self from the garvin family. soon after I changed my name the scandal broke , again I had no clue it was just luck on my part.  3.bill Dundee gets the credit  along with a thumbs up to lawler.  4.Bill Dundee and jerry Jarrett  5.A few days after Kerry passed I made the trip to Denton to talk to Fritz and eat breakfast. he took me out to the spot where Kerry had died. as I looked over he had tears in his eyes and said   I honestly had no clue that this boy would have done this, I loved him so much.  I felt a lot of sorrow for the entire Von Erich family. and no ill will. I loved them all from Doris to Kevin to Chris.',0),(481,'xombieCHRIST','Thoughts on the rock as a wrestler?  On his acting skills and do you think youd have a chance I you were to challenge him?','I think that hes like most 3rd generation wrestlers, the rock has been going to matches since hes been walking and there is no substitute for 2nd or third generation wrestlers, not to mention he was a great athlete before he even put boots on. when I had retired I move from dallas to my home town of Louisville ky. my son wanted to go to a wwf show. so I took he and a friend of his and they let me in the back like I was still a wrestler because I had so many friends working. even though Dwayne was main eventing that night, he spent a half hour talking with my son and his friend, for that ill always be a rock fan. and as far as his acting abilities  be cool  the character he played was so unlike him in real life, I thought he did a great job as an actor and hes grown with each role. so I am a rock fan, at the peak of my career I believe we would have torn the house down if we had a match together, the guy is a performer.',0),(482,'xombieCHRIST','Which wrestlers death didnt surprise you?  One that was bound to happen, and why?','Chris Von Erich, the youngest of the von erichs, unfortunately he wanted to be a wreslter so very bad and Kerry and Kevin asked me to help train him and because of that I did. I also wrestled in a match with percy pringle  paul Bearer  where we tag teamed against chris and kevin for one of his first matches in the sportatorium. chris was not the athlete of his brothers and a lot smaller, but he really wanted to be a wrestler. short into his career he broke his arm and I think that he knew he would never make it big like the rest of the boys. they say that when someone commits suicide in your family it makes it easier for a sibling to do it and I talked to him about that and he said   no worries brother I wouldnt do that , less than a year later he killed himself. It hurt.',0),(483,'xombieCHRIST',' :)  If I could ask a follow-up question, why do you think there hasnt been any real move to unionise the business, given the dangers you mention?','there has been attempts to unionize over the years, in fact, I was once at a big show and the great johnny valentine was there on cruches. along with quite a few older wrestlers, mad dog vauchon was there in a wheel chair bcuse he had a leg amputation. john was a very close friend and I had been talking to him, upon seeing mad dog instead of saying hello or how are you. he turns to him and says  this is the bastard that backstabbed me when I tried to unionize the sport!  john had later told me that in the 60s he tried to organize the wrestlers and had support but when it came time to stand up to promoters they all turned and ran because they were scared of losing their jobs. I found ironic that heres men in their late 60s one on cruches, and one in a wheel chair because of what they did for a living. it kind of gave me insight of what I had to look forward to in my older age and as well as I should be a lot more careful with my money.',0),(484,'xombieCHRIST','How much juicing actually goes on?  Is it promoted within the sport?','I cant say how much goes on today, but im not going to lie. I was a small guy I only stood 511 and weighed 220 and was wrestling guys that were 65 325 lbs. speaking for myself I did do steroids to try and keep up and to make injuries heal faster. in the 80s it was an unwritten rule that if you wanted a top spot you have to have a body, not to say that all wrestler did steroids, that would be a lie. but more than should have did. and the promoters turned their back to it all they cared about was having good looking bodies that could perform every night. if we didnt wrestle we didnt eat. something you need to think about in the sport of professional wrestling their is no union, they do not provide health insurance, or retirement plan and back in the day you were paid according to the number of people in the seats, which still pretty much holds true to this day.',0),(485,'xombieCHRIST','Did you ever blade and what is your opinion on its use or lack of use in todays wrestling?','yes I have the scars to prove it, there was a saying in wrestling. blood draws money, only the hot angles would do blade jobs. and when it was regional territories more of that went on because you could get away with it on tv, however when we started wrestling on ESPN a rule was set per the network,  no blood was to be shown  they thought it was too violent. so if you bled they blurred it or you didnt do it, you reserved it for a house show. and I think that a lot of the networks dont want blood today. remember before the internet people werent as smart to the business as they are today, we wrestled 6 or 7 nights a week sometimes twice a day in the same towns every week, the same matches were performed every night in every town yet the people didnt know because there was no internet to tell you what happened in Memphis if your wrestling in Louisville.',0),(486,'xombieCHRIST','Whats Jerry Lawler really like?','Jerry was extremely funny to be around, yet had a dark side. I remember picking him up at the airport and we were driving to the building, there was a massacre in a taco bell in the irving texas area and when I told Jerry thats where the 13 people had been killed, he insisted on going in and eating there. It kind of made my skin crawl, however as far as a business man and in ring performer I always made money with him and he was one the easiest people to work with on the planet. Hes one of the wrestlers who could take a broomstick or a person out of the audience and have a match with them that the people would enjoy watching.',0),(487,'xombieCHRIST',' Do you feel that when he got to the WWF they underutilized him?   Also, is there anyone from today that you would get in the ring with?','Unfortunatly by the time Kerry entered the WWF he had some problems, he was a great guy and very dear friend. in fact he came to see me the day before he shot himself. I feel as though if Kerry would have entered the WWF in the mid 80s he could have taken the place of the ultimate warrior. by the time Kerry started wrestling he had already had his foot amputated and wasnt dependable as far as showing up every night, his death still bothers me and I think of him often. Im sorry but once I retired from wrestling I no longer watch it, I havent watched a wwf show since percy pringle  paul bearer  passed. however I have seen the rocks work and I think hes outstanding inside and outside the ring. theres just something about second generation wrestlers you cant beat.',0),(488,'xombieCHRIST','Do you think a union should be set up for pro-wrestlers, given how dangerous the sport is and how many wrestlers have suffered as a result both during and after their careers?','absolutly there should be a union, although im not a pro union person. there should be something in place to take care of wrestlers as far as health insurance and retirement plan. the window for making money as a wrestler is very short and were not talking about a lot of guys that have graduated college, although some have, most are not. when your young and make a lot of money you dont know what to do with it. injuries can take away your lively hood forever and something needs to be done to protect the wrestlers that give their bodies to the promoters and fans. although vince wouldnt let that happen, he would fire everyone and hire new people.',0),(489,'xombieCHRIST','  Have you seen any of this?   Any thoughts?','I respect the fact that your son is doing something that takes that much athleticism. you sound like a good parent for supporting what hes doing all you can do is raise your children to the best of your abilities and try to instill values in them. it is a very new sport and all you can do is support him to the best of your ability, I love seeing a parent that cares about what their son is doing and I respect you for doing that, good luck',0),(490,'xombieCHRIST','Have wrestlers been taken advantage of by promoters?  How has it changed over the years?   Do you like the commercialization of wrestling?  Its given the wrestlers more fame and money, but what are the negatives, in your opinion?','wrestling today has pretty much destroyed the wrestling of my generation and what I grew up with.when I started there was a promotion in almost every state, you could work 6 months to a year in one territory and make a  good  living, upon finishing you would have a starting date in another territory and never miss a beat. at that time each promotion employed about 20 wrestlers so you do the math on how many positions were available compared to today, where you only have two large promotions where you can make a living. kudos to vince McMahan for making the money that he did but thumbs down for him killing wrestling as I know it.',0),(491,'xombieCHRIST','What is the attitude of wrestlers towards the referees?','Great question. They are actually the third man in the ring and as important as the two men performing the match, a good referee will make all the difference in the world. a  bad one can kill a match. I always respected any ref, its a hard thankless job, the fans only boo them , never cheer them',0),(492,'xombieCHRIST','What enticed you to get into being a pro wrestler?   Did you watch this while growing up, and aspired to it?','thats a great question and thank you for recognizing the athleticism thats involved, it was a controlled fight, people did get hurt just like in dancing. what you did took an extreme amount of talent as well and I applaud you for it, and yes I did watch it growing up, I met superstar Dundee and he thought that I was a true to life character and was always athletic and played sports so I tried. little did I know id be headlining cards within a couple years',0),(493,'xombieCHRIST','  * What was a typical draw (number of actual tickets sold for the rest of those reading) for Global?   * Worst receipt you ever got that you felt you deserved?   * Best road story?   * Best promoter you ever worked for and why?   * Worst promoter you ever worked for and why?','1. in the beginning, they could sell dallas sportatorium (5,000)  and like with any other territory it had ups and downs. a bad night would be a thousand.  2.probably Kerry von erich after I opened his head with a hair. we were doing a match in san Antonio and I hit him 3 times with a steel chair. 2 nights later we wrestled again in another town, he still had tape on his forehead. it wasnt a matter of if he was gonna give me a receipt it was how quick it was gonna happen. it occurred about 3 seconds after the lock up. he gave me a discus punch that rattled my chin.  ',0),(494,'xombieCHRIST','Ive heard that drug abuse was pretty rampant amongst wrestlers. Is this true?','You have a lot of young men who get hurt and have to have surgeries doctors were always prescribing pain killers to help us preform on a nightly basis so sometimes addictions would occur and a lot of the guys thought it was normal to eat a few pain killers in order to perform. The problem is as the injuries mount up it takes more and more to go out and perform then you have a problem now Im not saying everyone relied on them but certainly more so than in most professions.',0),(495,'xombieCHRIST','How has the sport taken a toll on your body?','6 knee surgeries 2 left shoulder surgeries. 1 neck fusion c456 with titanium plate. I have 12 bulged disks 4 herniated disks calcium diposits and bone spurs. its pretty much a chore to get out of bed, the falls are  real',0),(496,'xombieCHRIST','Jeebus that is scary, it sounds really unregulated, is there any real oversight outside of standard OSHA style stuff?','It is an unregulated profession in so many ways and only a handful of wrestlers are making big money. We had unwritten rules such as not to hit each other in the nose or try to maim each other but injuries occur all the time. If you were hurt and didnt wrestle you didnt get paid so we respected each others earning ability however from time to time tempers would flair.',0),(497,'xombieCHRIST','How accurate was the movie The Wrestler?  (if you watched it?','it was a pretty good depiction of what some of us live like, and of someone who hung on too long. you have to know when to get out.',0),(498,'xombieCHRIST','Do you think the role women play in the sport has too much sexual ambiguity involved or is a marketing hole that needs to be filled?','everyone enjoys TNA and im not talking about the other promotion lol. but the name on the marquee is wrestling. and its gotten away from that very thing. its become a soap opera. it used to be you had fat guys short guys, small guys, midgets and bears and everyone from all walks of life, but they all had one thing in common. they could wrestle. my question to you is. of the talent working today how many can actually  wrestle  ',0),(499,'xombieCHRIST','How did your 40 wrestling friends die?  Were many/all of them wrestling related, and any actually in or around the ring?','From natural causes, suicides, drug ods or medication complication. Only a couple to in ring complications',0),(500,'xombieCHRIST','Wen did you know it was your time?  What made you get out?','The business changed and went from territories to being eaten up by vince mcmahans television monster, I didnt want to be like the character  the wrestler  who was trying to eek a living out by any means necessary. the toll on my body was just getting to great',0),(501,'xombieCHRIST','When you did color commentary, were you trained for it?  And if so, by who?   Also, what was the worst move youve ever taken that didnt end with an injury?','no I flew from the cuff, all from the cuff. it just so happened the promoter of that territory and I quote  you are one of the best workers in the business today, but your also one of the biggest shit disturbers  he knew I could draw heat behind the mic because I pissed him off constantly.  powerslam from me jumping off the top rope. I didnt get hurt but I didnt want to have sex for a week.',0),(502,'xombieCHRIST','Who were you the most proud to share the ring with?   Who were you most terrified to go up against in a match?','I was most proud to share the ring with many great wrestlers. I thought it was neat that I ended up wrestling many men that I watched growing up like Bill Dundee and jerry lawler and jimmy valiant. EDIT: also Randy Savage  I can honestly say I was ever scared to go against anyone, some of the tougher matches were against Abdullah the butcher because Iknew a fork was going to be stuck in my forehead. but I wasnt scared',0),(503,'xombieCHRIST','would you do it all again?','sad to say I probably would, but hindsight is 20/20 I wish I would have went to college. I missed my children growing up.',0),(504,'xombieCHRIST','Do you have any more thoughts/stories about Mick Foley?','mick is probably the nicest wrestler I ever met, I have nothing but good memories of mick, hes a great guy and also, a very good businessman. but many times I told him  you are going to kill yourself if you keep it up, you better think about when you get old  because when it came down to it, he was slap ass crazy, but nothing but love for mick',0),(505,'xombieCHRIST','Best wrestling friend and moment?  Pranks?','toss up between bill superstar Dundee or cowboy john mantel, or gorgeous gary young. winning the global light heavyweight championship on ESPN was a great moment. we used to use these liquid farts we got at spencers gift and go to the bar and drop it on whoever was trying to pick up girls.',0),(506,'xombieCHRIST','what did it feel like for you to watch the movie?','Its would be like an attorney watching a john grisham movie.',0),(507,'xombieCHRIST','How would you suggest getting into wrestling?  Obviously you need training, but for someone trying to make it to the big stage of WWE one day, what advice would you give?','look for someone that has a school that actually can place you and give you experience working matches, theres man by the name of danny davis who runs a promotion called OVW out of Louisville ky, hes had it for years and been a developmental territory for WWF and TNA.  they are very well thought of in the business.',0),(508,'xombieCHRIST','Do you find it disheartening that WWE/TNA wrestlers are kept out of SAG because they claim it is a sport, while at the same time, everyone in SAG openly admits it is a work?','I find it very ironic that they tell you its entertainment and its on TV yet the men preforming cannot get a SAG card. It makes you wonder, by the way VERY good question!!',0),(509,'xombieCHRIST',' Were you aware of this?','No I was not, but why would Hogan want a union when hes making the most money. it would take money out of his pocket. he was the fat cat at the top man',0),(510,'xombieCHRIST','Did you like being a hairdresser?','Yes I actually had a very good business in Nashville and did a lot of country music stars hair.   came from. in 1986 I charged 35 dollars for a haircut and 80 for a perm. and was book 2 weeks in advance.',0),(511,'xombieCHRIST','[Still got the pink mat? com/watch?','no I cut it up and sold and gave the proceeds to the American heart association because my dad died of a heart attack, its the one charity ive always supported.',0),(512,'xombieCHRIST','Thoughts on the Ultimate Warrior?',' I remember when he and sting broke in, I remember the promoter telling them to only do body slams because they couldnt work for crap. ive seen some of his shoot interviews and it seems like he has a little bit of hate built up. cant we all get along?',0),(513,'xombieCHRIST','With savings from your wrestling career?','What are you? a cop? an IRS agent?',0),(514,'xombieCHRIST','  What was your favorite match you competed in?

For the record, most of the work was done straight and sober.',0),(42,'stephenkinghere','  So, a question: what is the relationship between The Regulators and Desperation?  Was it just throwing off the covers of Bachman by naming everyone the same?  Or is there more thematic connective tissue?','Desperation and the Regulators was like a reparatory theater where the same actors played different parts.

Does that number have a special meaning for you personally?','Well, not ALWAYS aliens or spiders, but think about it: are spiders the most alien creatures on earth, or what? Ive just got a thing about them. I dont usually use snakes, because they dont creep me out. The horn is from the Robert Browning poem.

That image became JOYLAND, which is out now.',0),(50,'stephenkinghere','I live in Maine.

Is there any form of civil disobedience they could reasonably engage in to fight for our privacy?','Heres what Googles been saying.  Theyre still constrained, but are pushing back against the secrecy that shrouds the program:  This morning we sent the following letter to the offices of the Attorney General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Read the full text below. -Ed.  Dear Attorney General Holder and Director Mueller  Google has worked tremendously hard over the past fifteen years to earn our users trust. For example, we offer encryption across our services; we have hired some of the best security engineers in the world; and we have consistently pushed back on overly broad government requests for our users data.   We have always made clear that we comply with valid legal requests. And last week, the Director of National Intelligence acknowledged that service providers have received Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests.   Assertions in the press that our compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered access to our users data are simply untrue. However, government nondisclosure obligations regarding the number of FISA national security requests that Google receives, as well as the number of accounts covered by those requests, fuel that speculation.  We therefore ask you to help make it possible for Google to publish in our Transparency Report aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosuresin terms of both the number we receive and their scope. Googles numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made. Google has nothing to hide.   Google appreciates that you authorized the recent disclosure of general numbers for national security letters. There have been no adverse consequences arising from their publication, and in fact more companies are receiving your approval to do so as a result of Googles initiative. Transparency here will likewise serve the public interest without harming national security.  We will be making this letter public and await your response.

The RestoreTheFourth activity seems incredibly important, and many of our orgs are looking for ways to support those events.    Weve had a number of elected officials speak out in support of investigations and accountability, and a substantial minority of elected officials have been voting against Patriot Act and FISA Amendments Act reauthorization in recent years -- some specifically because of their concerns about these programs.  We need to figure out ways to support and work with them.',0),(113,'davidadamsegal','I believe zip codes are optional, but they help determine which members of Congress to send the letter to.

Do you think that producing the new season as a prequel to the movie took away from its potential?  Who is your favorite non-Bluth character?  What can you tell us about the movie?  Whered the lighter fluid come from?','*What is your favorite line ever from the show?*  Thats REALLY hard because there are really clever lines, there are lines that are delivered really well - sometimes the less clever stuff thats delivered by these genius actors well becomes my favorite line. Right now, one of my favorite lines is when George Sr introduces Buster in episode 6 and hes in the Winnebago and George says  As you see, my sons in the Army, Buster say hello  and Buster says  hmm.    *Do you think that producing the new season as a prequel to the movie took away from its potential?*  Im going to try to interpret that question because it could mean a couple things. One version of that question is  Do I think it will hurt the chances that the movie will get made  - and I would say that Im more interested in telling the ongoing saga of this family than working out a particular strategy for how to do it. I kind of feel like the form will emerge in a way that I wouldnt have anticipated - like Netflix a few years ago - so its possible that a film studio says  Theres a lot of AD out there. Do we want to invest in more  or its possible that a film studio says  Wow, we had no idea there was this kind of a following.  And I think the latter scenario is possible. Just because I didnt think there was that kind of a following! But if your question is  Does the story weve told detract from a movie , I would say it definitely doesnt, or wasnt intended to - it was intended to set up (among other things) a murder-mystery and a family that really now has to come together to save one of their own at a moment when their tensions are the highest.   *Who is your favorite non-Bluth character?*  My favorite non-Bluth characters are the 3 guys in the 1920s Mexican film where we saw the origin of the Chicken Dance. Their names are Gustavo, Enrique, and Paco (*whose name is also actually Gustavo). And they were played by Jason, Will and Tony.  *What can you tell us about the movie?*  Another ambiguous question! Well what were calling the movie is just the ongoing story - so at the moment, there is nothing really up with it, except that I am gathering up ammunition to try to get the next chapter made.  *Whered the lighter fluid come from?*  Gob and most magicians start their day by strapping a number of implements and bladders to their body. They write playing cards on their arms, they tape magnets to their legs, they run hoses down their sleeves, and they attach small flints to their fingers. This is one of the hilarious things about magicians. Spoiler alert: theres no such thing as magic. So the lighter fluid comes from a small bladder that is squeezed by his left arm. Dont tell.',0),(119,'MitchHurwitz','Maeby and George Michael had that   fake  wedding ceremony to entertain Alzheimers patients - but it was said that it was real and then never mentioned again.

Thanks to you, now Ive remembered!',0),(120,'MitchHurwitz','Mr. Hurwitz, what is the craziest storyline or scene that never made it into the show?','Believe it or not, I dont think there IS one! Because every time I think of something thats too outlandish, I end up trying to find a way to use it. I remember pitching Buster loses his hand as a bad example to motivate the writers to think outside the box.and then a moment later, I thought  Hey, why dont we have Buster lose his hand? ',0),(121,'MitchHurwitz','If you could be any Bluth, which would you be?  And which would you definitely not want to be?','  I think I would not want to be Mark - I always wanted there to be a 5th Bluth sibling that didnt give his permission to be in the show. And it was an ambition that I had from the very start. And I realized during the pilot that Id blown it, because all the family pictures should have 5 people in them with one blurred. This was the joke that I ended up doing with Andy Richter. The joke was going to be that his name was Mark - in one version of the joke, the reason that he didnt want to be on the show was because he had a giant red wine birthmark all over his face - and suddenly it didnt seem as noble that he didnt want to be in the show. But it was very clear that I missed that opportunity early on.   Who would I want to be? I guess Id want to be Tobias, because hes the most oblivious and the happiest. And hes the dreamer. And he doesnt know how unrealistic his dreams are, so hes happy. ',0),(122,'MitchHurwitz','Was Ann Veal named after an anvil?','Yea, there were a lot of things that her name was made out of - Anvil was definitely part of it. The image of a veal padding pen. And theres an old Monty Python skit where John Cleeses characters name is  An Elk  - it was an oblique reference to that too. Her original name was  Fugly.  We were going to name her something Fugly - and then it felt a little too jokey and they fortunately didnt allow us to say it.',0),(123,'MitchHurwitz','I am wondering if there was any inspiration in real life that led to the idea of Tobias being a Never Nude?','No, there wasnt. The Never Nude thing - I will trace the etiology of that idea, and its this. We had this joke that just put us out, that was Tobias keeps crying in the shower. And then I had pitched - I was thinking about production, and the way they shoot those things, they always put people in flesh colored bathing suits, and I said, what if we show part of the flesh colored bathing suits for 3-4 weeks - and then in the 4th week we reveal that he showers in a flesh-colored bathing suit because he doesnt like showering naked. And then Richie Rosenstock (whos an absolutely brilliant, hilarious guy - and is responsible for so many of the giant laughs in the show) said without hesitation:  Oh, hes a Never Nude.   And everybody in the room froze. And looked at him, and said,  is that a real thing?  and he shrugged, and it was just so funny. It wasnt a funny idea until Richie called him a Never Nude, which took the joke from being just a sight gag, to a psychological affliction that really elevated it in such a brilliant way.  And then I remember looking up to see online if there was such a thing as a Never Nude - and guess what you cant search for besides finding pornography?  Never Nude  - back then youd get 25,000 pages with the word  Nude  in it. Even if you used the Boolean quotation marks, you would still get things like  Hot 18 year old whod NEVER been NUDE in front of a boy!  So well never know if it was a thing before ARRESTED. Although I suppose I could just ask Richie.',0),(124,'MitchHurwitz',' My question is regarding your methodology  how in the hell did you keep all of these storylines straight during the writing process?  On February 11, 2006 What were your thoughts of continuing the Bluth story?  Did you think you had a shot in hell at ever telling more?','It was one of the bigger challenges, and this woman Joey Slamon who was a co-producer on the show turned out to be really gifted at keeping track of that stuff while I was straining to do the same. But mostly, it was all worked out in advance as best as possible and then the holes were patched in post and there was some re-shooting. And I think it would have been much easier if we had shot in sequence, but youre right, it did require a lot of thinking (for example)  Wait a minute. If Tobias has already been to the clinic, and Gob doesnt pick up deBrie until after the clinic, then theres no way Lindsay would be wearing the red wig at the dinner yet.  It was constantly stopping and thinking REALLY hard.   But the bigger answer is that its not really anything other than hard work, and stopping and trying to be really present at every moment of the production.   On February 11, I DID. Theres an audacity that comes with any creative enterprise. I mean, I dont think I would have written my first spec script if I had known how unlikely it was to get a writing job. And I dont think I would have tried creating ARRESTED if I really thought  look at the data of whats already been developed. they wont make this.  but I should have - that was the evidence that existed. I dont think I would have included all the stuff about Saddam Hussein in Season 1 if Id done the math on the likelihood of getting through an entire season to reveal the punchline. And I think that everyone has to jump off that cliff and make that assumption in their own work - because the truth is, even if it doesnt happen, you have a more interesting life if youre to sit down and write a novel than doing the math on the likelihood of it getting published. ',0),(125,'MitchHurwitz','Is there any joke that nobody seemed to get that you found hilarious?','Heres the thing: I dont know what nobody seems to get. I mean, sometimes I think that nobody has noticed something, and then Ill hear that someone does. My older brother was over yesterday, and he was pointing out all these really subtle things that I didnt think anybody would  notice. And some of the stuff may be well-known now - my favorite joke is who the real George Maharis is - because thats a punchline we didnt finish. Basically the joke is, he doesnt want to be George Michael, because George Michael had sex in a public mens room, and he doesnt want to be Boy George, because Boy George had sex in a public mens room, so he settles on the name George Maharis. but a little research will show that name has a similar fate. That being said, I think the groupthink on reddit has caught all the jokes that weve layered in - except for the ones we havent finished yet, which are setting up for a future story.',0),(126,'MitchHurwitz','How often did you go over the set and writing to make sure all the subtle running gags and references were in there?','Constantly. This is probably a question about the first 3 seasons, I had a monitor in the writers room that would show what was going on onstage and a producer on set that I could call back and forth, and I was just constantly running over there, at least twice in each scene that was shot. Once to get it set up, and then once to show up toward the end and pick up the pieces we didnt get.  The blue handprints, for instance, were CONSTANTLY painted over by the set crew - and I would have to make new ones, and we would have to re-shoot, so it would take effort to create a consistent world.   Thanks for the words - what i was experimenting with then was the idea of putting things in the show that had no apparent payoff until later, and at that time, it was very difficult to get that kind of stuff in, because i was doing the show for the network and there was a notes process and people would say  you can cut this,  and  this slows us down,  and things like that, but it was kind of an experiment and Im glad it worked.',0),(127,'MitchHurwitz','What does your chicken dance look like?','Like this.  ( HURWITZ DOES CHICKEN DANCE )',0),(128,'MitchHurwitz','Great show, love season 4! Question: Whats your writing process?','It depends on the assignment, and it depends on the challenge in front of me. I personally have no testable, repeatable writing process. Its very strange. Sometimes I type, sometimes I write longhand, sometimes I think, sometimes I dictate, sometimes I just call things out on the set. Ill write scripts in the room, Ill perhaps sit at the keyboard and the script is up on the computer, and ive printed out the outlines and working through it, and soliciting help and questions as we go along - so it becomes a very democratic process. I used to do a pass again (to clarify it and trim it) - on this last show, I had to do a lot of that on the set, which was really a hardship for the actors but made it also really fun and fresh, because wed find the stuff right there.  But if Im writing a pilot, its a whole different process. Its very solitary. So my process is inconsistent. And I try to keep it flexible. I think all of being creative is about being flexible, and not getting into any fixed ideas. Id watch (as I came up) how the writers room worked - it would be 6 people pitching on a variation of  Were not open all night  and one person saying  What if a car drives through the front of the building  - its really trying to stay flexible and not get trapped into one way of thinking. Thats why Buster losing his arm is such an interesting example - I was pitching it as a bad example, not letting myself think that way for a series, and then re-examining that premise and that idea. ',0),(129,'MitchHurwitz',' Hurwitz, How have internet communities(Reddit, Twitter, etc) changed the way TV is enjoyed or discussed?  Has it impacted your end of things(writing, creating, pitching)?','I think its going to have a big impact. I think its going to allow the more creative ideas and the more innovative people and the more ambitious people to have a place to experiment without the burden of having to hit a 20 million person audience on the first night. And one of the burdens that network television implicitly has - theyre not allowed to just respect the cleverest in their audience, they have to please everyone. And I think the Netflix model makes it a little more like publishing - there are different books for different people, and still within that world there are top 10 books that are blockbusters, and then theres fiction thats not for everybody.  In an interview recently, someone asked me  Hey, what did you think of that New York Times review?  A guy at the NY Times watched 5 shows at 3 in the morning and then said  I dont like this  on day 1 - it was a bad way to start. And I dont blame him - try watching something in the middle of the night and see how you like it, especially if it means skipping brunch with your daughter on Memorial Day weekend. And in response, I said -  It sounds like he really didnt like it. But you know who did like it?  And the interviewer said  Who?  And I said  People who really liked it!  (which is true - its NOT for him, its for them!)',0),(130,'MitchHurwitz','Who decided that  a piece of shoe  was the best prop/choice for George Srs Yamaka?','Well, heres what I will say generally about that - Tambor is such a consummate actor, that one of the things I wanted to do in that first season was give him no warddrobe to change, to give him no props to hold (other than a cup of coffee) - he doesnt get to go anywhere, and even the furniture is nailed down. I liked the idea of him being in prison, because he could use no comedic tools besides what he has - it was like a Masters acting class.  We later came up with Oscar (which gave him a LOT to play with) but this season, i wanted to even want to limit that by making them dress alike, have the same haircut - Tambor is like a racehorse, I wanted to see what he could do.    So when it came time to make a yarmulke, all we had left ourselves to make it out of was his shoe.',0),(131,'MitchHurwitz','Hi, Mr. Hurwitz  I want to download/buy the song  Getaway  by Mark Cherry to use it as a ringtone, how can I have it?','We are really working on it, actually! Its tricky because 20th doesnt really have a record label, which a lot of the other studios do, so they dont have a mechanism in place, but all of Davids music is so great and I really want to get it out there. ',0),(132,'MitchHurwitz','  * Were the Facebook notification sounds in season 4 intentional?  * Would you consider a 5th season in the same format as the 4th, or would you follow the fans calls to have all actors together, however difficult that would be?  * Movie or Season?  If you could choose one to end Arrested Development, regardless of time and money limitations, what would you pick?','that is a David Schwartz question (the shows composer - he did an AMA too) and I will have to ask him. I didnt hear it in the mix we had, but on Netflix, it IS clear for some reason. All the music feels a little bit louder. You assume that 10-20% of the sound gets knocked down, so we make the music a little hotter because it gets cut on broadcast. But I have the feeling he did it on purpose.  For the 5th season, it would DEFINITELY be about the family all together. That was always the design. The idea was originally to have them even together LESS for Season 4 - it really was going to be basically 9 stories (like the Salinger collection) that had nothing to do with one another, and just showed everybodys life, so that everybodys life could get to a point of peril, and then the family could truly have no choice but to get back together for the next iteration.  Let me put it back to you- which would YOU prefer? Movie or Season?',0),(133,'MitchHurwitz','What do all the ostrich references in season 4 symbolize?','There are a few things going on there, and I never think its appropriate for an author to comment on the symbolism in his work. But one of the things I liked, truly on a superficial level, is that its a truly funny bird. Its a mean chicken the size of a man, and its an ungainly creature that cant seem to gain flight. So theres a lot in there.',0),(134,'MitchHurwitz','Why was Tobias lying in the fireplace in a couple episodes?','There has been more theorizing about that online - Im amazed that question got through, because Ive seen questions about this for YEARS. David Cross has been approached about it for years, and heres the unfortunate answer; it was a joke that didnt work. I walked onto the set, and there was nothing funny happening in the scene, so I said,  Hey, what if David is leaning back into the fireplace relaxing?  and then when I went into the penthouse in another scene, David had decided to do it again. And people constantly write  I dont get it!  (and unfortunately they DO get it - its a man in a fireplace!)',0),(135,'MitchHurwitz',' I was wondering how much creative freedom did Netflix give you guys?  Were they pretty generous?','100%. Netflix was amazing. Ive become very close to the people over there, and they are all really funny, so if they did have suggestions, they were generally pretty funny, great ones - particularly Ted Sarandos, who runs content for them. And they loved the ambition of the show, and encouraged it.  If you look at the transition from radio to television, the first 15-20 years were basically just radio shows on TV. I didnt want to just do a series on Netflix, I wanted to see what the form would allow. And they dug that idea. ',0),(136,'MitchHurwitz','There are hints that Tobias is actually a black albino. Was that ever going to be a full storyline?','Im going to second /u/uzumymus comment - that if I did want to do that, revealing that now would be ruining the joke. So perhaps you can think of another joke I can ruin for you that I can feel less bad about. ',0),(137,'MitchHurwitz','Do your children know to always leave a note?','Ive had other object lessons that Ive worked hard to teach them. Fortunately, I have a friend who strangles small animals and Ive been able to use him successfully to remind them to wear their retainers, etc. ',0),(138,'MitchHurwitz','How satisfying is it to see so many of the actors from AD popping up in  Archer?   Was that amount of overlap acknowledged in the running gag about the Bluths not tipping black men, even on a train?','I love ARCHER and dont know the particular thread youre talking about, so no there is no overlap intended. but lets go ahead and say YES. We completely intended that overlap. ',0),(139,'MitchHurwitz',' I just wanted to ask you what was the motive for creating Arrested Development?','There are many answers to that question! But if the question is, what the inspiration was - Ron Howard came to me with the idea of doing a documentary-style show, or maybe David Nevins came to me with an idea - and then when I got into the creative part of it, a lot of it is based on families Ive known, my own family at times, and a lot of it was based on what was going on in the world at that time. But ultimately (and like everything in the show, it was a process of layering) - I think William Faulkner claims that he saw the book THE SOUND AND THE FURY as a lightning bolt that illuminated a landscape and showed him the whole story - this was nothing like that. I think most writers just keep layering and building, and I started with the idea of a set of twins, and one was conservative, and one was liberal. And that gave birth to the idea of the children of those twins, where one was fearless and one was fearful. And then a MILLION other things happened. And those ideas are just so deep down in the pile that theyre almost unrecognizable. ',0),(140,'MitchHurwitz','Will we ever meet the last of the richter quintuplets?  Chareth: The Flirt?','Right now, Chareth is in a Turkish prison, and we havent even been able to get the actor out to shoot his stuff. wait, well now that you mention it, YES, Im ashamed we didnt get him into this series. All I can say is, Andy Richter *does* have to be back in Burbank by 2 PM every day. So it makes it tough to get all Richter Quintuplets on the set. ',0),(141,'MitchHurwitz',' Is there any truth to that theory?','The thing about ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is Ive always liked the idea that nothing is as it seems on the outside. So since it seems to you that she might be a man, then its very possible shes actually a woman. ',0),(142,'MitchHurwitz','My name is Chickens_dont_clap and I approve this AMA! Why did you cut off right when we were about to see George Michaels chicken dance in Season 4?','I dont know - it just seemed funnier! Its almost like negative space in art. Or a rest in music. Sometimes its funnier to have the moment occur, and sometimes its funnier to not have the moment occur, and in that moment it felt like it would be funnier to NOT see it.  Also (*and this could just be personal preference), I saw his Chicken Dance, and chickens dont do that. ',0),(143,'MitchHurwitz','Who is a guest star you wanted but couldnt get?','I spent a little while trying to get Howard Stern for something. I did want to get Jerry Bruckheimer, and he was too busy.  I did want to get Maria Bamford even before we started. I knew that we needed to get her, and I was willing to move the whole shoot to accommodate that. ',0),(144,'MitchHurwitz','What is your favorite ~~magic trick~~ illusion that Gob attempts?','I think I like the one where he has the Queen of Hearts written on his chest, because I had to work so hard to hide the punchline (which was that it ended up on Michaels shirt). And because it was wrong.',0),(145,'MitchHurwitz','Who came up with the name Crindy?  Was it legit or just a troll?','My recollection is that I came up with Crindy and that i did it on the set. The problem with writing in a room is attribution becomes very challenging to trace. You know, ideas build on one another, the idea of Gob not knowing his brides name is integral to even getting to the idea of Crindy, and several people often think that theyve thought of the same joke. So most professionals try to resist crediting something to one writer or another unless its really just a clear, precise, moment in the writers room. But theres kind of an acceptance of the idea that were all in this together. ',0),(146,'MitchHurwitz','Where can I buy a Cornballer?','I actually saw something online the other day that looked like a Cornballer - ours was made out of a deep-fryer and parts of an aquarium. ',0),(147,'MitchHurwitz','Mr. Hurwitz, can I please work at the banana stand?','There is one on Balboa Island, I think theyre hiring. And you can say that Ive thoroughly vetted you and think you would be an ideal candidate, if that helps.',0),(148,'MitchHurwitz',' Maybe I missed it but how did Lucille Two fall down the staircase?  Was it her vertigo or did someone really push her?','Thats one of the abiding mysteries that Film Studios (or Netflix) will have to find valuable enough to discover to fund more of the show. And whats YOUR theory? Im truly curious. ',0),(149,'MitchHurwitz','where can i buy two children?','Haha!',0),(150,'weareradiolab','org/?   What do you like about This American Life and how has that show influenced the production and storytelling behind Radiolab?','RK: First off, Iras show was, is, and has continued to be, a generation-definer. So many people who have become cultural icons, David Sadaris, Dave Eggers, Dan Savage, Sarah Vowell, and on and on and on, took big bows on his show.and the thing is, he noticed them early. Thats a rare skill -- to display a generation as its blossoming. Thats one thing Ira did.   But then there are his editing skils.Like Jad, (but unlike Jad) he has created a mood, a tone that is distinct, artful, and very him. Its a subtle, subtle skill.(Jad is wondering what that means.it means two very sharp minds have created to very distinctly sharp sounds) Anyway, theres all that, and then theres the journalism, the breakthroughs in explanatory economic reporting, the investigative pieces about the Georgia judge, the Chicago guns.Its an amazing achievement, TAL is.and its definitely our constant inspiration.    JA:  Everything RK just said.  Im consistently envious of TAL.  I still diagram TAL stories to better understand story structure.   Just an amazing show.  Hard to summarize.',0),(151,'weareradiolab',' Was this a conscious decision, or is it just hard to come up with so many cool science stories?','Im not sure we make the distinction youre making.  And if you look at the past few months, you see:  a couple stories on particle physics, an extended treatment of epigenetics, a long story on prenatal ethics.  In other words, science.  but weve never claimed to be just a science show.  Were interested in a lot of things, just like you.  And anyway, science and scientists share the world we all share, fight for resources, suffer, compete, cheat.  In a broad sense, all that is science too.',0),(152,'weareradiolab','What is your favorite piece youve ever done that didnt air?','We dont have pieces that never air.  We have pieces that havent aired yet.  Thatd be like giving up on your child.  You cruel person. ',0),(153,'weareradiolab','  Why havent you discussed this situation on the show?','We absolutely stand by everything hes ever contributed to the show.  Because of his situation, weve triple checked everything he said.   As for whether well have him on again:  Its complicated.  But what it comes down to for him, and for anyone, is.for what topic?  If hes the best person to talk to, then yes.  Likening the situation to Mike Daisey is comparing apples and oranges.  He didnt lie to us. Mike lied to TAL.',0),(154,'weareradiolab','Have you ever been surprised by the reactions of the audience to your live shows as compared to your radio/podcasts?','RK:  well, our audiences in the live shows are alive, as in physically present.  so surprises do happen.  one time in st lake city, i started talking about a particular fountain that i had just seen and liked and the audience got instantly chilly.  turned out, it was a church financed high end shopping center that had pissed everybody off, but how would you know that?  JA:  live audiences always surprise me.  just the mere fact that people are actually there in the hall when we step out on to stage.  that they showed up.  thats always surprising.',0),(155,'weareradiolab',' Is it possible that with all of the sounds and music that are in each podcast, to have the artist information posted with the podcast?','Theoretically.yes.   The problem is that so often, when I use a bit of someone elses music in the show, its been bent and twisted and torqued in so many ways that its unrecognizable.  and were always so down to the wire with our deadlines that we never have time to reflect and make that list.  but youre right, we should.',0),(156,'weareradiolab',' How do you guys pick each topic?  Has there been any topics that you started to delve into but actually never found enough answers too and had to give up on?','On number 2:  Cant think of one specifically, but we do put stories on the shelf from time to time.  Sometimes a story is a great story but it doesnt make friends easily. And sometimes the fun ones take not months but years to confess themselves.  In year 1, you think  too complicated.   In year 2, you think  i dont care anymore.   In year 3, you suddenly think Oh! and out it comes.  Year 4, regret. ',0),(157,'weareradiolab','Whats the weirdest, most astonishing story you guys have covered since starting Radiolab?','JA:  Finding Emilie.  That story haunts me.  RK:  Bringing a beam of light to a complete halt.  And then moving it.  That was boggling of mind. ',0),(158,'weareradiolab',' Abumarade?   With a sufficiently brown nose, my question: has there been an instance where you thought Radiolab wouldnt be popular, where you thought it was close to being canceled, or had a disagreement that threatened its life?  Or has it always been sex, drugs, and rock and roll for the Radiolab crew?  Bonus question: Whats the endgame?','Pretty much yes to all questions.  Double yes to the sex drugs rock n roll.  Too many yesses?  Yes to that too.  Actually, in all honesty, we never thought this show would go anywhere.  In fact, the first time we went on the air, replacing Fresh Air for a week, the audience came at us with a level of unbridled rage that still gives us the chills, when we care to reminisce, which is never.  ',0),(159,'weareradiolab',' How much time and preparation went into your last tour?','We rehearsed with Pilobolus for a few days in the Armory and came out with a rough architecture.  Actually, the show you saw, in Berkeley, that was the first one, and we hadnt even finished setting the lighting cues and wed never done a complete runthrough of that show.  We were all kinda terrified.  Anyhow, we got through it and then spent the next 9 months editing the show in front of our audience. ',0),(160,'weareradiolab',' Although scientifically speaking I cant be sure can I?  Ive listened to most of the episodes multiple times, and Im sure one of the reasons why is the great music and sound, which brings me to my question:  Are you guys planing on ever releasing a Radiolab Soundtrack?','Thank you for that question.  Ill pay you later.   Short answer:  yes.  We (or at least I) fantasize about starting a Radiolab record label.    RK:  the difficulty being that my cuts will mostly star Mary Martin and Ethel Merman.  JA:  sigh ',0),(161,'weareradiolab','Any chance we will see a TVLab someday?','Perhaps.  But it wouldnt be a simple TV translation of Radiolab.  That would probably fail and be embarrassing for everyone involved.  But maybe a TV show that breaks the rules in some ways we havent yet imagined. ',0),(162,'weareradiolab','  My question is, what sort of topics are your favorites to research and connect?  Do you stay away from certain subjects?','Until recently, weve avoided topical subjects, because our shows have a long shelf life, and we like it that way.  But then a few weeks ago we did a supreme court show.  Increasingly, the stories that we (or should say I.Jad here speaking) like researching and reporting are the ones where a situation leads you to a place of no easy answers.  Robert?  RK: Me too.  ',0),(163,'weareradiolab','  What is your writing and recording schedule like?','We brainstorm and bat ideas around as a group, starting at our Friday editorial meetings but really at any time of the day of night, well be emailing eachother ideas and thoughts.  Studio sessions happen a couple times a week, and generally consist of Robert and I improvising for hours just to get a line that works.  Its a kind of torture, really.  But a giggle one.',0),(164,'weareradiolab',' Any thoughts about a show that looks at the  spaces in-between,  how certain things may be connected without us knowing or how we may find meaning in things that may not connected, a la Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon?   Also, if I have a story or topic that may interest you, what would be the best way to be a part of Radiolab (submission or volunteer work for stories)?','You point to something we talk about a lot.  The hidden connections between seemingly unrelated phenomenon.  As for the similarities, well thats because this is two people doing it together and every friendship has colors and moods that repeat from time to time.    If you wanna send us story ideas (and please do), hit us at radiolab@wnyc.org',0),(165,'weareradiolab',' Are these disagreements always based off of your actual opinions, or are they ever created for the purpose of better illustrating both sides of a story?','RK: Mostly theyre pretty authentic disagreements.  Jad something which doesnt go far enough or goes too far and I bark.  But to be fair, there is an artistry to this and sometimes he makes bark short, then bark long, bark high and then bark low.  Then he chooses the best bark. ',0),(166,'weareradiolab','I love your use of music to explain other things (colour for instance). Are you musicians yourselves?','JA:  yup.  studied music for years and years and secretly I think Im still doing it.  RK: Yup. Sung in the shower for years and years. Got wet, but hey, thats what we artists have to do, sometimes. Soap helped. ',0),(167,'weareradiolab','How are the end credits actually produced?  Do you guys call the people and ask them to read off of a script?  Or do you ask them to do it in a later date?  Do all of them follow through?   Also, Jad, do you ever get annoyed by how many times people during the end credits pronounce your last name incorrectly?','For the credits, we send our guests a list of names, thats all.  And I dont mind people mispronouncing my name.  Actually, I need it to feel normal.',0),(168,'weareradiolab','Whats are the components to a great science story?    Also, do you accept pitches?  Is so, how do you sort through them?','Hard question to answer succinctly.  I guess the key is that the puzzle, question or conflict should hold our attention.  Thats really the only valid criteria in the end.is this something that you hear and cant turn away from?',0),(169,'weareradiolab',' Which would you say are your personal favorite episodes?','Rk:  I like  Stress  mostly because I love Robert Sapolsky.  Though anything with Strogatz in it is better than anything without him.  JA: I cant say I have a favorite.  I go through cycles of loving and hating them all.',0),(170,'weareradiolab',' Was there ever a subject that you guys ever wanted to cover that ended up being too taboo or controversial to air?','Actually thats the secret reason for this program.  Neither of us have ever been good at parties.  So the show was invented to give both of us a  party boost.   One mention of quantum foam and were gold.',0),(171,'weareradiolab',' How do you decide what to talk about on the show?  Also, which Radiolab episode is your favorite?','We just talk.  And then we edit that and do it again.  And then we edit THAT and do it again.  And again.',0),(172,'weareradiolab','  If you didnt know how old you were, how old would you be?  Whats in Radiolabs future?  More tours?  Less episodes?   Whats your (both Jad and Robert) singular most rewarding experience during your years creating Radiolab?','RK:  Im 27.  But strangely, I can remember specific things about President Eisenhower.  JA: Not sure what that means K, but Im 27 too.   In the future?  Probably more tours.  Really the goal would to keep doing the show but never the same each time.

You obviously discuss it but who writes what and how do you organize your ideas or settle differences?','We both do everything together. We sit in front of one computer at one desk and we make huge lists of ideas that slowly evolve into the movie. We outline the emotional stories and the structure for a long time and then we write the dialogue. All sitting six inches from each other. the whole time.  Ever since we started when we were 13, weve done everything together (except for acting). Even when we were in separate cities, we would write over the phone. If we dont agree on something, its like any team or partnership, we just debate it until we reach an amicable middle ground. Also we have a lot of great people that we work with - Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shapir, Alex Mcatee, and our producing partner James Weaver, and we bounce stuff off them all the time.',0),(228,'SethAndEvan','Why was Jonah so angry in his Rolling Stone interview?','I think sometimes they just catch us on a bad day. I talked to that guy for about two hours and when I went home I was like  jesus, I said about two thousand things that could make me look like a complete motherfucker . Alot of it is luck of the draw as to what the people will choose to use, and how they want the article to be. Jonah is not bruce banner in real life. ',0),(229,'SethAndEvan','Dopest dope youve ever smoked?','Whoooo. toughy. The first time I went to amsterdam when I was 19 I was alone waiting to meet a friend, so I went into a coffee shop and asked for the strongest weed they had. I smoked a huge joint of it alone and then sat alone in the coffee shop for two hours having no idea what to do. I kept thinking my giant backpack was in peoples way. ',0),(230,'SethAndEvan','How the hell did you proposition the actors for This Is The End?','Well, Seth had noticed that in magazine interviews Rihanna had said that some of her favorite movies were SUPERBAD and PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, so it was a shot in the dark and she said yes. Emma Watson, we just kind of reached out. And everybody else we knew in some capacity and called them up as a friend, and asked if they wanted to come to New Orleans and die really quickly. ',0),(231,'SethAndEvan','I heard Emma Watson walked off the set because you were high. Is this true?','No. That would make for a wonderful story though. Emma seemed super psyched with how everything went and even came to our premier to do press. I think if youre that put off by weed, odds are you arent working with us in the first place. ',0),(232,'SethAndEvan','You guys have stated that some of the funniest jokes in Superbad were from the original script that you two wrote when you were 13 year olds. What is one of the jokes that stands out from the original script that eventually made it into the movie?',' funny thing about my back. its located on my cock.    And.   Mclovin. ',0),(233,'SethAndEvan','**Seth:** Whats the one joke or line in one of your films that made your parents roll their eyes and say Really, son?   **Evan:** Why dont you act in the films you write?','My parents sometimes get sick of me talking about weed on talkshows and shit like that. They finally said to me  jesus, do you have to talk about weed all the fucking time?  but people always asks so I dont know what to say.   Evan: I dont act because I have a bad memory and third eyeball. ',0),(234,'SethAndEvan','Where does a celebrity buy weed from?','I have a prescription, so I buy it from a store. Its a fucking dream come true. ',0),(235,'SethAndEvan',' What do you think is the best way to get my foot in the door?  PA work?  Writers assistant?  Working as a personal assistant to an established producer?  None of the above?   * How do you go about writing with a partner?  Do you both write in separate locations or are you always in the same room?','Thanks so much. Working for established people is a great way to break in if you can do that. I always tell people to just make their own content and if its good, itll break through. do standup, make funny or die videos, get a youtube channel, write scripts, make movies, just do it. you can make a movie on your phone nowadays, so just do whatever you think is hysterical and original. We always write together. Because we love each other. ',0),(236,'SethAndEvan','I love you. You are the funniest guy in the world, what is your opinion on the illegal downloading of movies?','I personally dont do that because it does take money out of peoples pockets. sometimes very small films rely on sales to make any money. Huge movies are okay to ilegally download though. Ha! download man of steel all you want. ',0),(237,'SethAndEvan','Seth: what is your reaction to Freaks and Geeks becoming such a revered and celebrated tv show?','Its fucking crazy. When it got cancelled, there werent really shows on dvd and netflix didnt exist, so there was no precedent for shows that got cancelled to come back to life. We thought it was done. And now more people probably watch it than when it was on in the first place, which is awesome and unexpected. Im blown away by it. ',0),(238,'SethAndEvan','Man of Steel wouldnt happen to be up against any other movies this weekend would it?','are you implying that we are petty and competitive? Cause we are. ',0),(239,'SethAndEvan','Was the house in the movie actually James Francos home?','No. The inside was built in a warehouse that was used to store coffee beans. The outside was largely computer generated. I dont think franco actually has a house. He lives in a library like the bum in  With Honors . ',0),(240,'SethAndEvan',' Where did the inspiration for the crazy, coke-blowing George Michael Bluth come from?','We thought up the character first - someone who is just a cokehead, maniac sex-deviant - and then retroactively, we thought who would be the most surprising person to see in the role. So we chose the sweetest, most beautiful, innocent boy in the world, Michael Cera. ',0),(241,'SethAndEvan','Did you guys have much luck with girls in high school?','No, thats why we made SUPERBAD. If youre having trouble not getting laid, take that frustration and put that towards a future career, because its not going to immediately change the fact that youre not getting laid.',0),(242,'SethAndEvan','Seth, you were a writer for Sacha Baron Cohen on the Ali G Showwhat was that like?','It was great. It was mine and Evans first actual job together. We would think of people he could interview and then write the questions that he would ask the people, while trying to predict what the people we are interviewing might say. We went on the road to texas and then to spring break in florida where we exposed frat boys as being much more homo-erotic than they would have liked. ',0),(243,'SethAndEvan',' How high are you right now?','Im about Harrison Ford right now.',0),(244,'SethAndEvan','How much of This is the End was ad libbed?','About 50%. The actors came up with a lot of crazy shit, and topped our script a lot more than wed like to admit.',0),(245,'SethAndEvan','What is the best advice youve ever received?',' Never touch the pole in a strip club.  - Evans Dad',0),(246,'SethAndEvan','Seth, Ive been following you on twitter and you still seem to be pretty down to Earth, have you noticed any changes in yourself since youve become famous?','I only eat off diamond plates and my cutlery is made from the bones of christian babies. But other than that Im same ol seth. ',0),(247,'SethAndEvan','DID YOU DOWNLOAD THE YEEZUS LEAK?','You bet your ass I did. Im shocked he made a song inspired by our film  guilt trip  but Im flattered. ',0),(248,'SethAndEvan','What is your favorite movie youve done?','Probably THIS IS THE END and PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. Theyre both just so fucking crazy, and specifically I think we enjoyed making these we were thinking the whole time  I cant believe theyre letting us make this.   On a different note, I, Evan, would like to note that I didnt work on OBSERVE &amp; REPORT but wish I had, because of how cool it is. ',0),(249,'SethAndEvan','Did you guys already have her in mind to play the part before/while writing the script?','Yeah. We wrote the part for her and then went out and asked her. We where fucking shocked when she said yes. ',0),(250,'SethAndEvan','Are you two really making a movie about Kim Jong Il?','It is not Kim Jong Il, it is his son, Kim Jong Un. Were doing it with James Franco. Were shooting in Vancouver. Were super-excited!',0),(251,'SethAndEvan','Have you ever used real marijuana while shooting those scenes?','Were not as unprofessional as people might think.',0),(252,'SethAndEvan','Whats your biggest piece of advice for writing comedies?','My biggest piece of advice to anybody is just to finish what you start. Because if you dont finish stuff, youre just trying to be a writer. When you finish it, youre a writer. And specifically regarding comedy, share with a lot of your friends; dont be isolationist about it, try to get a lot of opinions and try writing with a partner - it works for me!',0),(253,'SethAndEvan','What is the worst thing Evan asked a cast member to do and they refused?','I asked Craig if he would say a bunch of terrible things about Mother Teressa and he almost did it but then politely asked that we not push that joke and we begrudgingly let it go. ',0),(254,'SethAndEvan','How sexy is Franco on a scale of 1-10?','James Franco is an 11 out of 10 on the sex-o-meter.',0),(255,'SethAndEvan','Was there anyone in particular that you wanted to kill during filming because of any reason?','The answer to any question -  who could you not believe was there?   Rihanna.    Who did you most want to kill?   Rihanna.   If we were killing someone or just thrilled to have someone on set, it was Rihanna. She is more famous than everyone else on the film combined. ',0),(256,'SethAndEvan','Whats your tradition for opening weekend on a movie?','I usually stress out like crazy and yell and people for no reason as a way of dealing with my insecurities. ',0),(257,'SethAndEvan','Who are your favorite people to smoke weed with?','I mostly like smoking weed with babies. ',0),(258,'SethAndEvan',' My question : did you toke with any of the Backstreet Boys?','We did not get high with the Backstreet Boys. Well find out if they do that in the sequel. Besides, they dont need drugs or alcohol. All they need is each other.',0),(259,'SethAndEvan','What is the proper term: sneakers or tennis shoes?','As Canadians, we find  sneakers  humorous and refer to them as  runners,  which makes a lot more sense. You dont sneak around in them, you run or walk.',0),(260,'SethAndEvan','Which of your many, many quotable lines do you get shouted at you walking down the street?','This is Evan; neither of us really get lines shouted at us. Seth used to get  You know how i know YOURE gay?  a lot, but now no one cares about him or me. Were just dust in the wind.',0),(261,'SethAndEvan','Who is the weirdest person you know?','Probably Michel Gondry. He is the least normal human Ive ever met in my life; hes from a different planet made of styrofoam and lego, where physics and logic are not the same as in our world.',0),(262,'SethAndEvan',' I wanted to say thanks for being so chill about greeting your fans, and I wanted to ask you if we are wearing the same glasses?  Penguin, right?','Ha. No. Raybans. But you are very handsome. ',0),(263,'SethAndEvan','were you actually stoned when you filmed any of your scenes?','Probably in a residual sense but its hard to act really high. for me anyway. ',0),(264,'SethAndEvan','What type of music do you like?','I like all types. Been listening to Ab-soul, Chance the rapper, tylers new album, yeezus!, daft punk, and of course, Crosby Stills Nash and Young',0),(265,'SethAndEvan','What was your process in casting the celebrity cameos for This is the End?    Was it just  Lets think of some random celebrities to put in this thing?   or did you already have each celebrity role in mind when writing?   Also, was there anyone who you wanted to have guest star but didnt end up getting?','We wanted a mix of people who you would expect us to be with and not expect. We started with our closer friends and then built from there. We always wrote the parts for the people specifically. A few people had scheduling conflicts, but pretty much everybody was into it which was rad. ',0),(266,'SethAndEvan','Which do you like better, things or stuff?','Id say that things are undeniably better, because stuff sucks shit.',0),(267,'SethAndEvan','Would you rather make a movie that did poorly in theaters and turned out to be a cult classic, or one that was a box office hit but was virtually forgotten in a year?','The first one. Weve made both those types of movies (people dont like to admit it, but Green hornet made a shitload of money) and it feels much more gratifying to make movies that people love but arent as successful. Kind of. ',0),(268,'SethAndEvan','Why is Evan never in any of the movies you guys write?','I am in the last scene in this is the end dancing with my wife',0),(269,'SethAndEvan','Would you direct a new generation of Freaks &amp; Geeks if you had the chance?','No, I have nothing to do with the creative elements of that show, I was just an actor and I dont have the right to do that.',0),(270,'SethAndEvan','Which was your favorite scene to film in This Is The End?  Which was your favorite to write?','We loved filming what we refer to as the cum battle. The writing of the first party scene was fun because it was great to see who we could get to do what crazy shit. ',0),(271,'SethAndEvan','Favorite band?','Our favorite band mutually is Led Zeppelin. ',0),(272,'SethAndEvan',' Was it your first time doing standup?  Did you write down your jokes and rehearse beforehand?','If its the clip Im thinking of, its not my first show. It was something called  comedy night in canada  and it was my biggest show id ever done at that time. I think around 400 people or something. I think Im around 15 in that video. I may be wearing a  Korn  shirt. ',0),(273,'SethAndEvan','How would you describe This is the Ends sense of humor?','Spunk-a-riffic! Our movie has more jerk-off or cum jokes than any movie ever made, and its a title we hold proudly. ',0),(274,'SethAndEvan',' Have you ever considered starting your own?','We talk about making our own podcast a lot. The idea is to do a show that reviews people who review movies and other things.   Because there have been too many nights where weve gone to sleep asking ourselves.  *who watches the watchmen?*',0),(275,'SethAndEvan','If you had to have Randy Newmans voice, which era of Randy Newmans voice would you want?','The  Toy Story  Era of Newman.',0),(276,'SethAndEvan','Does Craig really sweat a lot in real life?','Yes he does. He actually carries a sweat towel around with him all the time because as he puts it,  Im always sweating or about to sweat . ',0),(277,'SethAndEvan','Hi Seth and Evan Which would you say was your most stressful movie to make?  And which one was the best or funniest to make?','GREEN HORNET was definitely the most stressful. 50/50, SUPERBAD and THIS IS THE END were all a lot of fun.',0),(278,'SethAndEvan','well, hows your wife enjoying her dog?','She loves our dog more than most people love their babies. ',0),(279,'SethAndEvan',' Two questions:    Is Danny McBride actually a jerk, or is he cool?    And, are you and James Franco as close as the movie makes you out to be?','Danny is actually the sweetest guy on earth. Hes married and has a baby and I dont think has ever attempted to murder someone.   Me and franco are close, but hes super busy and he never listens anymore! ',0),(280,'SethAndEvan','Evan -- who would win in a fight: Franco, McBride, Jonah, Craig or Seth pretending to be Franco pretending to be Harry Osborn from Spider Man?','Hmm.I would say it would be Jonah, playing the Seth from SUPERBAD, whos actually being played by the Seth from Seths life in the Green Goblin outfit and womens underwear.',0),(281,'SethAndEvan',' Intentional or no?  I mean, I didnt really figure you guys had much to do with the music anyways, I just wanted to know if you guys were Deftones fans?','That is a coincidence, but we did actually pick pretty much all the music in the movie, and I was HUGE in to deftones in high school. Seven words is a fucking sick song. ',0),(282,'SethAndEvan','What projects do you guys have planned after this movie?','We already made another movie with Seth, Rose Byrne, and Zach Efron, called TOWNIES, about Seth and Rose raising a child next to a frat and they go to war. ',0),(283,'SethAndEvan','These are the only questions I could come up with:  What are your favorite beers?   What are your favorite South Park episodes?','Man. I like Canadian beers. Kokanee is what I grew up drinking, so Im partial to it.   Southpark: hard. Imaginationland is amazing. when jimmy gets a hooker. The world of warcraft one is rad. so many. ',0),(284,'SethAndEvan',' but are all of you guys going to continue to collaborate and make more comedies in the future? ?','I hope so. Were about to direct another movie with me and Franco. and we have some stuff with Jonah and the others that were working on too.   shout out to Nick Theodorakis!',0),(285,'SethAndEvan',') in order to write movies?','I was pretty good at English literature (this is Evan speaking) - I was bad at almost everything else. I probably couldnt do this job in French, or Hebrew, or Aramaic.',0),(286,'SethAndEvan',' what were the cards you wanted to make?  and after you got rich did you buy a black lotus?','Ha. I dont think I ever got the black lotus. The royal assassin was a hot commodity. I am a fucking nerd. ',0),(287,'SethAndEvan','What is you favorite type of pie?','Lemon meringue pie is by far the king of all pies, and the other answer is WRONG!',0),(288,'SethAndEvan','Hey guys, so Jonah got his nomination. Which member of the cast do you see getting an Oscar nom next and why?','Probably not me! Maybe Jay. Hes been in movies that have won oscars and whatnot',0),(289,'SethAndEvan','Which movie is your favorite comedy?','My favorite comedy is SPACEBALLS (this is Evan). I think Mel Brooks is the funniest man ever.',0),(290,'SethAndEvan','What was your opinion on the whole Youtube Comedy Week?','I had a lot of fun doing it (this is Seth) - it was very entertaining. What did YOU think?',0),(291,'SethAndEvan','Who is your man crush?','Chris Messina. Hes everything I will never be. ',0),(292,'SethAndEvan',' Great food, or the greatest food?','Depends on the burrito. Breakfast burrito: greatest food. ',0),(293,'VICEJasonMojica','Had the north koreans seen the previous piece youd done on them?  Were they into it?','With something like one-hundredth of one-percent of North Koreans having access to a computer, I dont think your average man on the street has seen our multiple docs on North Korea. However, the people we were dealing with certainly had. One of the folks from the DPRKs UN mission informed me that his colleagues in Pyongyang thought I was a  very, very bad person.  When we arrived in North Korea, I was pulled off the bus that everyone was on and made to ride in a car with a woman who explained to me that  I know who you are, I know your work, I know VICEs work. I dont like you, I dont like your company. I didnt want you to come, but I was over-ruled.   It was an interesting  welcome to North Korea. ',0),(294,'VICEJasonMojica','Havent seen the show yet (living in the netherlands) but did you revisit the tea girl who was on the vice guide to north korea?','We wished we could have! If I remember correctly, Shane met her on the way to the DMZ, which leads to an interesting thing about our trip: our hosts/minders actively avoided taking us to anything military-related. Sure, there were reminders of the 3rd nuclear test everywhere, but they wouldnt take us to the places that are typically on the dog-and-pony show: the DMZ, the war museum, the USS Pueblo. Instead we got. well, youll have to watch tonight to see what we got, but it led us to ask ourselves at one point,  are we traveling around with the liberals of North Korea?  I mean, a lot of the folks we were dealing with were from the DPRK Olympic Committee, others had worked at the countys embassies abroad, so these are people who know what the real world is like, and I got the feeling they would be fucking thrilled if North Korea could have better relations with the U.S. and the rest of the world. ',0),(295,'VICEJasonMojica','This piece received a lot of attention and mixed reviews for being either unethical or sensationalist journalism. Do you have any regrets or response to that?','The funny thing is, the bulk of those criticisms came about 3 hours after we landed in Pyongyang. So basically, we were on day-1 of production and meanwhile many in the outside world had already made up their minds about what we were doing there.  To be fair, this certainly does not fit the mold of  traditional  journalism. But we are not stenographers. We are a group of people who are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to get at difficult stories. North Korea is probably the most difficult place in the world to get in to, and even more so for us, considering our work highlighting [North Koreas labor camps in Russia](http://www.vice.com/vice-news/north-korean-labor-camps-part-1), and more recently on the HBO show, a piece unsubtly called  ESCAPE FROM NORTH KOREA  [(watch a web-extra here)](http://www.vice.com/vice-on-hbo-outtakes/escape-from-north-korea-hanawon-resettlement-center), so getting in required taking a page out of the diplomats playbook.',0),(296,'VICEJasonMojica','Hey there I am a huge fan of your work for year now and Im now in love with your new show on HBO  Now you have done stories in North Korea multiple times now and I am just wondering if you had less security or it was easier to get filming and stuff done when you had Dennis Rodman with you?','I think the big difference of this trip, one which we only realized a few days into our trip, was that Kim Jong Un personally gave this trip his blessing (remember, that we had NO idea we were going to meet him, or that he would attend the game. Of course we *asked*, but we werent holding our breath). So I think to some degree, our minders and security folks were a bit scared of offending us.   On the way into the country, a guy searching my back picked something up and said,  GPS?  I said,  yes, GPS.  He looked nervously at me, knowing full well that it was not allowed in the country and he jammed it back in my bag and moved me along. So I think they skipped a lot of the more intrusive searches and seizures for fear of pissing us off, which could in turn piss off Kim Jon Un, which is a no-no.',0),(297,'VICEJasonMojica','Did you have to follow any conditions before they let you play against them?  did they have score restriction to stop them looking bad?   What would you say was the most eye-opening/unexpected thing you saw whilst out there?','To be clear, we didnt play a game *against* the North Korean national team. We played a playground-style pickup game, with two of the Globetrotters as team captains picking teammates. VICE correspondent Ryan Duffy was in the game, and did pretty damn good. Oh, sorry. conditions. No, there were no restrictive conditions, no funny rules, just multi-hour meeting in which I had to explain the concept of a pickup game to a dozen men in suits.',0),(298,'VICEJasonMojica','Did you see any from the modern outside world that seemed shockingly out of place  a contemporary movie poster, an unexpected meme, or use of the word  YOLO  by a North Korean handler?','Yes, there were entire stores filled with out-of-place goods. Kind of Potemkin shopping malls where, in spite of US sanctions, you could purchase Coca-Cola, Doritos, and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish. Most of these goods are bought on the grey market in places like Singapore (which is where the Coke was from, for example) and shipped in.',0),(299,'VICEJasonMojica','How long did it take to get entrance into North Korea after you decided you wanted to go?','It took somewhere between six and eight months of back and forth with both the DPRKs mission to the UN and some back-channel sweet-talking. But considering the previous work weve done on North Korea, we frankly never expected it to happen. In fact, I didnt believe it until we were on the plane to Pyongyang.',0),(300,'VICEJasonMojica','Did any of you guys get to meet Kim Jong-un?','We did. Watch tonight and see it!',0),(301,'VICEJasonMojica',' Are you saying there were no cracked walls, peeling paint, or dilapidated buildings?','Oh, theres plenty of decay. At one point while we were driving through Pyongyang, I saw these amazing, monolithic, concrete apartment complexes that had a kind of Corbusier feel to them, except they repeated as far as the eye could see, and they looked like nature was reclaiming them. I asked when they were built. Our minder said,  1993. ',0),(302,'VICEJasonMojica','Why do you think they agreed to let you back in knowing what you guys were about?','I suppose it had to do with the fact that the Supreme Leader wanted us to come. I dont get the impression that theres a great deal of insubordination there.',0),(303,'VICEJasonMojica','How are VICE crews able to get the level of access seen on the show with groups all around the world?  How do you approach people who might not necessarily be friendly towards Americans and convince them to meet and be filmed for American TV?   Also, can you *please* push to extend the show to a full hour?','I get this question a lot and everyone hates the answer: you ask.   Be straight with people, tell them what you want to do and why you want to do it. They either say yes or they say no.   Admittedly, when they say yes, it feels pretty good.',0),(304,'VICEJasonMojica','Do you think your hotel room was bugged?  , if so, did you choose your words carefully in conversations?','Yes. We spoke only in Star Wars analogies.',0),(305,'VICEJasonMojica','  A) Has the HBO show helped Vice gain more exposure?   B) What sort of feedback have you had this season, do people like the 2 shorter documentaries per episode format, or would viewers prefer a 1 hour documentary?','A) Yes. HBO is the gold-standard and now my mom actually knows what I do for a living.  B) I think everyones got an opinion on this one, but you need to keep in mind not every story *should* be an hour long. ',0),(306,'VICEJasonMojica','Have you seen any of the North Korean video of the game?  If so, was it edited?','I saw people commenting on that, but no, its all legit. I think the editing had more to do with the fact that they had more camera-angles than they knew what to do with.',0),(307,'VICEJasonMojica','What assurances did you have that they would not simply throw you in a labor camp?','No assurances at all, so we were very. polite.',0),(308,'VICEJasonMojica','whats the one thing you remember most from your trip?','Sitting across a dinner table from Kim Jong Un.',0),(309,'VICEJasonMojica',' What was the craziest thing you saw on the trip?  What other VICE documentaries should I watch?','1. Kim Jong Ils dead body.  2. [The Vice Guide to Karachi](http://www.vice.com/the-vice-guide-to-travel/the-vice-guide-to-karachi-full-length), which I produced and was hosted by my pal Suroosh.',0),(310,'VICEJasonMojica','How much contact did you have with US officials leading up to the trip and did you meet with them upon your return?','Not at all, but I assume the NSA was on top of it.',0),(311,'VICEJasonMojica','What were the attitudes of NKs players like?  Did they seem enthusiastic?','They were great. Talented and super-enthusiastic. For some more insight into them, look for the web extra that I think goes online tomorrow which features a clip of the lunch we had with the players after the game',0),(312,'VICEJasonMojica','But seriously, why dont you get an hour on HBO?','Send HBO a letter. A real letter. In the mail.',0),(313,'VICEJasonMojica','What kind of footage do you have which didnt make the final cut?  Anything interesting that didnt make it?','Theres so much footage. Were hoping to release a longer version of it in the not-too-distant future.',0),(314,'VICEJasonMojica','Ive seen reports that marijuana use is basically tolerated in North Korea. Did you guys witness any marijuana smoking going on while you were there?','To the chagrin of at least one member of our crew, we did not encounter any marijuana. ',0),(315,'VICEJasonMojica','This isnt the first time VICE has gone to North Korea:   Can you tell us how this time was different?    Were you ever scared for your safety?    Did you karaoke?','We never had any time for karaoke. Our days were packed full of activities, and when we got back to our hotel at night, we had epic meetings about what wed be doing the next day.    ',0),(316,'VICEJasonMojica','What sort of indoctrination schemes did they use when you arrived in North Korea?  Did you stay at the hotel on the island, or where did you stay?  What were the accommodations like in the hotel?  How is Shane Smith doing these days?','There were NK propaganda videos playing on the 1.5 hour flight from Beijing and we had a nice selection of state-sanctioned reading material to choose from.',0),(317,'VICEJasonMojica','do you know if the show will ever be shown here in the uk?','The show will premiere in the UK very soon, on Sky Atlantic, I believe.',0),(318,'VICEJasonMojica','Source?  propaganda to get people or riled up about North Korea or is it true?','Feeling like we couldnt speak freely.',0),(319,'VICEJasonMojica','Given the recent tensions, would you ever consider going back?   If so, would your coverage have a different focus?','I would love to go back. Id like to open a Vice News bureau in Pyongyang.',0),(320,'VICEJasonMojica','Does Vice allow autonomy with stories or does do they micromanage?','*I* am the micromanager.',0),(321,'VICEJasonMojica','Totally unrelated to Korea, But what are our chances of getting a Second Season? ? ?','[Its on.](http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/hbo-renews-vice-1200496554/)',0),(322,'DannyMacAskill','how many attempts did it take to bounce from the ball to the track in your new video?','the ball front flip to the train tracks took about 250 takes.it was a lot harder on the cameraman than on me! He was having to run up and down with a steady cam. We worked out he ran about 6 Km in about 2 hours. I was dizzy by the end ',0),(323,'DannyMacAskill',' Ill keep it simple: How many broken bones during the years?  Which of these memories is your favorite?','I have broken both my feet several times.Ive got a pin in my right wrist, Ive broken my left collarbone 3 times, most memorable break was trying to keep up with Gee Atherton in practice for a downhill race in California which ended with me breaking my collarbone for the third time in 6 months.

Also is there anything youve found away from the bike that helps you develop your skills back on it?','Learning flip tricks its a good idea to go to your local skate park that has a foam pit, thats where I first learned to do front and back flips.

However both countries are committed to finishing the eradication. This is the project I spent most of my time on. We should be able to finish by 2018 although that will require raising funds and some great execution. We have some innovations like the way we use satellite maps to find all the villages and GPS tracking to make sure the teams go to every hut that are helping out.

How does the foundation differ from other large philanthropic organizations?','Our goals are focused on helping the poorest (globally) and improving education (in the US). We spend half of our money on global health. One metric to look at is reducing the number of children (under 5) who die. My annual letter talks about the amazing progress that has been made on this.  Amazingly as health improves families choose to have less kids so paradoxically population growth goes DOWN as you improve health helping with almost every issue - from stability to the environment..

Within 6 years we will have the last case. After that we will go after malaria and measles. Malaria kills over 500,000 kids every year mostly in Africa and did not get enough attention until the last decade. We also need vaccines to prevent HIV and TB which are making progress.',0),(428,'thisisbillgates','Whats your worst fear for the future of the world?','Hopefully we wont have terrorists using nuclear weapons or biological weapons.

Maybe medicine or theoretical math but it is hard to say.  Most giving is done by the middle class so it is the backbone of generosity particularly in the United States. A key thing is to support government aid which is only 1% of the budget but helps poor countries in incredible ways.

Is it only  CPU-instructions  or was there some higher level programming for it?','You are right that the processor does feel acient. Our current smarthphones are more powerful. The reasoning for this is three-fold. First of all, the computer was selected about 8 years ago, so we have the latest and greated space certified parts that existed then. Second of all, it was the most rubost and proven space grade processor at that time.  Thirdly, in order to make a processor radiation hardened it requires lots of tricks on the silicon that is not conducive to making it fast. Given that, it does not run any GUIs and can just focus on raw programming, and actually gets a lot done. All of the programming is done in C, and our toolchain is very similar to programming on any platform.  -JG',0),(537,'CuriosityMarsRover',' It seems there was a **lot** of pyro devices on curiosity, is that now a mature technology enough so you can pile it without adding too much risks ?','These devices are considered very reliable and are used on many spacecraft (NASA and commercial). Curiosity did have a lot of devices, but there was also a lot of redundancy built into the firing system. Many of the devices used on Curiosity had been used successfully on Sprit and Opportunity and Pathfinder, so there was a lot of previous experience here at JPL.  Not all of the pyros were for EDL - we actually had to fire off a set several hours after landing to deploy some of our surface hardware.  Testing the pyro system was a pretty big task - if any of them had been mismapped it could have been a bad day for the mission. Getting the timing right was also a challenging task for the EDL team. So in addition to the reliability of the device itself, we had to make sure we were firing the right device at the right time.

As the rover was landing, we were getting tons of telemetry down. I saw the telemetry that indicated that all of the EDL autonomous actions had completed, so that meant we were down. The biggest clue was that we were still getting radio from the rover for quite a few seconds after it claimed it had finished. That combined with the chatter that was happening on our voice net provided extra confirmation to me. There were a few of us that realized that we had landed safely at the same time (as I learned later), but I just could not hold it in.  Im glad you were able to watch this live along with all of us.

The Sky Crane is a really good way to land and accommodate varied terrain.  Its not a question of efficiency - although it seems really complicated, it actually illuminates a lot of problems with previous landers like having to get out/off of the lander or having the engines operating really close to the ground.  There were over 100kg of hydrazine still remaining - this is because we designed the Curiosity mission to be able to land a lot of different places and let the scientists decide where to go.

She can communicate directly with Earth with an X-band link.  Through the high gain antenna, which we can point directly at Earth, we can achieve ~10 kbps from Mars to Earth.  Most of our data is returned through the UHF relay links with MRO and ODY.  Currently MSL can top out at 2 megabits/second to MRO, but that is only at specific conditions.    We are designed to return ~250 megabits per sol (~31 megabytes).  Some days are better than this, while others are worse.  It depends on the range and angles between MSL and the orbiters.

Can you tell us more about how Curiositys components talk to each other?','We only use the C language for all of our programming to keep things simple. So no object oriented programming either.   The components on Curiosity are isolated from each other. The Cruise, Descent, and Rover stages all had their own power zones to keep them isolated from each other, with communication paths in between. We use a military grade communications bus that is tolerant to radiation and large amounts of noise for communication between most of the core components.

And how did you celebrate the landing?','250 scientists and about 160 engineers -- remember this is a 24.6/7 operation! Were working in shifts.  And how did we celebrate? To each his own. Tasty beverages, missed high-fives, well-deserved naps after shifts were over. :D - SLS',0),(564,'CuriosityMarsRover',') Is it inertial or is there something else going on?','The entry was guided by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which includes gyros and accelerometers.  The IMU was initialized with the attitude (orientation), the position and velocity of the spacecraft just prior to entry. We control the trajectory by rolling the spacecraft to point the direction of the lift vector to go deeper or shallower in the atmosphere.

Adorable. - SLS',0),(567,'CuriosityMarsRover','Does Rob Zimmerman, the Pyro guy, ever dreamed, as Tom Kelly for the LM Descent/Ascent stage separation back in Apollo days, that the bride cut will not work and that the skycrane will bring the rover and crash with him ?','Ive definitely had that nightmare. We did a lot of testing before we launched to make sure the right pyros fired at the right time, so deep down I knew it was all OK.  Luke Dubord (who did most of the pyro design) and I had an early high five when we saw that the cruise stage separated successfully.',0),(568,'CuriosityMarsRover','How long have you guys been working on this specific mission?','It varies for each person 1-to-10 years.

Sorry to ask this but what specific injuries or damages did you actually suffer?','Thanks!  If you didnt know about the attack and saw me on the street, you probably wouldnt even look twice. Kimberly Lee is one HELL of a good plastic surgeon!   But I suffered some pretty gruesome injuries to my face and head.  In fact, in the ER pics, you cant even tell Im a human being.  Ive had doctors look at the picture and turn it around trying to figure out where the face is in it.  Basically what happened is that the bear charged, grabbed me by the ears and bit into my face.  In doing so, it destroyed the bridge of my nose, tore off my ears, chewed out fourteen teeth and much of my upper gums and palate. It also ripped off my lips and tore apart my face and scalp. Kimberly Lee estimated that she put over a thousand stitches into my head and face during the first surgery.  Me right after surgery: http://i.imgur.com/gC2fSbP.jpg   Me today: http://i.imgur.com/VyFbW57.jpg  Dr.Lee is at www.kimberlyleemd.com www.kimberlyleemd.com  Edit: removed redundancy',0),(577,'allenahansen','If I ever found myself being attacked by a bear, what advice would you give me?','If its a Grizzly Bear, play dead. If youre in California, its a Black Bear. Fight back with everything youve got because its trying to kill you. If its a Polar Bear, youre fucked. ',0),(578,'allenahansen','Im morbidly curious-- could you see out of the eye that was hanging down your face?','My eyeball was not hanging down onto my face, but it was bitten and the other eye lid torn off. I only allowed myself a brief look into the rearview mirror, but it was so awful, I just laughed and kept driving. ',0),(579,'allenahansen','When you got to the fire station what did you say/do?    What did your dogs do once you called them over?  And did they survive?','When I got to the fire station, my big concern was that when they saw me, theyd faint, so I decided to try for levity. So I walked into the garage bay and yelled  Honey Im home!  Then proceeded to give them every bit of personal informatin I could remember: name, blood type, shoe size.  First off, they both lived, not that much worse for wear. Once I called them, they came running, I dont remember much after that, but there was a lot of fur and blood, and growling and yelping. They diverted the bear long enough for me to get up and escape.   Thank you! My surgeon, Kimberly Lee, M.D. is a genius, so if anyone out there need a face lift, give her office a call and tell them I sent you. Shes in Beverly Hills.',0),(580,'allenahansen','  Did you quit your job at the ranch?   Has this changed your perspective of animals?   Did you provoke the animal, or have any idea why it would attack you?','1: My ranch IS my job.  I cant quit it.  2:I have to admit, the whole misadventure has made me a lot more wary of animals with big teeth.  We tend to take for granted that theyre not going to kill us.  Sometimes thats just not true.. 3:I think it was a predatory attack by a desperate creature.  It was probably hungry, disoriented from the recent wildfire, and taking a territorial stand.  It certainly knew I was there, and it had been stalking me. Probably figured I was an easier dinner than a deer -- which has hooves and antlers and can outrun it.  Little old ladies arent supposed to fight back..',0),(581,'allenahansen','Did the dogs get out ok?','Both my dogs survived!  But its been almost five years and big dogs dont live all that long.  Dekes death really hit me hard. I miss him.',0),(582,'allenahansen','Did you have that moment of seeing your life flash before your eyes?','No.  Nor did I see Jesus. But I knew that this was the moment of my death, and it pissed me off enormously. So much in fact, that it inspired me to fight back -- which turned out to be the right decision.  I think.',0),(583,'allenahansen','The pain mustve been excruciating though, wasnt it?  Or were you in shock or something?','Mercifully, one forgets the actual sensation, but I wrote about it at the time, knowing I wouldnt remember what it was like if I didnt get it down in the near term.  The desire to survive overrides everything else, so the pain became superfluous to keeping myself alive.  Curiously, many of the nerves in my face were severed in the attack, so there wasnt a specific pain, just an overweening one.  And a whole lot of blood.  The horror was the hard part.  Numbing, in fact.',0),(584,'allenahansen','What was the drive to the fire station like for you?  What was going through your head?  but did you listen to music?','It was like the whackiest Disney ride ever.  I alternated between elation and despair, but figured what the heck, Im not likely to live through this anyway, so heres my one chance to drive like a total dickhead with impunity.  Fortunately, the dirt track was so remote, that the likelihood of running into anyone else was approaching nil.  Frankly, I expected to go careening over the cliffside, so I just spun the wheel and stomped on the brakes as the spirit moved me.  No music, just my maniacal laughter echoing off the canyon walls..  :-) ',0),(585,'allenahansen','How much were you medical bills?','My crappy insurance company only covered about 20% of what I needed done (Google: Mauled by a bear then mauled by Blue Cross), so Ill be paying these bills off for the rest of my life.  So far expenses have been about 300K and counting.',0),(586,'allenahansen','How did you deal with the whole ordeal after your first operation?','Well, I wrote a book. Surprisingly, I didnt have the expected nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks et al one might have expected.  Mostly, I was so stoked at the incredible job Dr. Lee had done on my reconstruction, I felt Id be letting everyone down if I didnt do my damndest to heal and recover.    Physically, I had to relearn how to speak, eat, even breathe properly.  But through it all, I was motivated by wanting to let people know that if a little old lady could survive something like this, so could they.  ',0),(587,'allenahansen','  Did you have any sensation at all that something was watching you?   How long was your recovery total?   What was the most difficult part of your recovery?   Do you have a partner and were they supportive?','I had no inkling that I was being watched, and was totally oblivious to the danger. Even my dogs were sound asleep in the creek bed about twenty feet from me.  The total recovery is ongoing, and its been about 4.5 years now.  Ive lived alone for the last twenty years, but my son, whod just graduated from College of William and Mary and was looking forward to his real life, kindly moved back in with me for several months to babysit  and drive me back and forth across the state for medical treatment.   Supportive  doesnt even come close.  Child is my angel.',0),(588,'allenahansen','What was going through your mind as you drove back down the mountain?','For one thing, I didnt expect to MAKE it down the mountain, so there was an air of the surreal about it; sort of like a crazed Disney ride. But mostly when I realized that I might indeed make it to the fire station, there was this enormous sense of elation.',0),(589,'allenahansen','If you were to do something to prevent this from happening to you again, what would you do?','When Im outside now, I watch my six! It was something of a fluke, as black bears rarely attack human beings.  But my tomboy girlfriends who like to run and bike in the backcountry learned a valuable lesson from this. We ALL make sure we go out with a dog or two now, and STAY ALERT!  Personally, I spend a lot of time looking up into the trees for lions.. ',0),(590,'allenahansen','?','Exactly.',0),(591,'allenahansen','Thanks so much for doing this I actually heard about you before. What breed are your dogs?','Deke was a masiff and RK is an Irish wolfhound. As it turns out, the two very best breeds I could have had in this situation, as the mastiff instinctively goes for ground (they were bred to bait bears) and the wolfhound keeps it at bay.',0),(592,'allenahansen',' I was curious how did the bear attack you?  Did you spot it, then it chased you down as you tried to run or did it just come out of nowhere and there was no time to react to it?','Sorry for that mix-up.  Im new to this format.   It had been waiting for me in a willow copse, and when I paused from my work for a moment, it rushed me and took me down.  One moment we made eye contact, and in the next I was in the fetal position in the sandy creek bed with this nightmare gnawing on my face.',0),(593,'allenahansen','  Wtf? ?  Is living near bears considered a pre-existing condition or something? ?','My policy doesnt cover dental, optical, or cosmetic -- the major injuries I suffered.   Health  insurance is the biggest scam on the planet.  The company makes their money by denying their policyholders service.  ',0),(594,'allenahansen','Is there anything you can compare that kind of pain to?','No.  Having a baby was a piece of cake in comparison.  Maybe like being smacked in the head by an anvil?',0),(595,'allenahansen',' How has your perspective of wildlife and protecting endagered dangerous animals changed?  Do you still enjoy the outdoors?','I still love the outdoors, but Im a lot more cautious about my surroundings. Some of the sanctity has been destroyed for me, and for that, I grieve. Im still an avid advocate for wild things, but until they start paying property tax Im going to assert my dominance.',0),(596,'allenahansen','What was the reaction of the people that helped you?  Could you talk at all to explain what happened?','The guys at the fire station were champs.  We all kept it as professional as possible and even managed a laugh or two out of it. I figured that if I kept them busy writing down my personal information theyd:  A.) Not faint  B.) Be able to indentify the body  So I gave them name, age, blood type, UCLA patient number, next of kin, size of shoe, anything I could think of to keep conscious until the heli-evac arrived from Mojave about twenty minutes later.',0),(597,'allenahansen','Have you ever thought of going back for him and getting revenge?','No.  In fact I rather identified with the beast inasmuch as it struck me that it was a refugee seeking a safe haven -- just as I was.  It was tracked for several days, but the hunters were unable to catch it.',0),(598,'allenahansen','what have you learned most from this experience?    Do you have a different outlook on life because of this happening?','To persist.  As to the second part of your question, Im still trying to figure that out.  I a bit more wary in the wild places -- which ruins some of the sanctity I used to find there, and I resent that.  But mostly Im the same person Ive always been, just a bit lumpier.',0),(599,'allenahansen',' I woke up during surgery with part of my scalp/face peeled back and it was a very strange experience but I was sedated - how was it for you?  I mean, obviously it was painful, but anything else?','It felt alien, cold, like it belonged to somebody else and I was just inside watching.',0),(600,'allenahansen','Did it seem to go in slow motion or was it more like a quick motion of you sticking its eye with your thumb and getting away?','Everything happened in real time.  No distortions at all.  I knew that should I survive this, Id have one hell of a story to tell, so I made a conscious decision to note and remember every possible detail so I could write it all down if I made it out of there.  And I did.  ',0),(601,'allenahansen','I would imagine that people driving next to you would see the blood coming from your face. Did anyone try and stop and help?','The  road  was more of a dirt trail than an actual road. Ive never seen another vehicle up there in all the years Ive lived here, so the chances Id run into anyone were slim indeed. ',0),(602,'allenahansen','  I can understand getting upset with a watermelon if **it** tried to bite your face off - thats one asshole of a watermelon; but a bear?','There are arsehole humans, too.  But I dont hold that against humanity.',0),(603,'allenahansen','Do bears mark their territory?  could this be an indication of a bears habitat nearby?','Yes, bears do scratch bark as a marker, but mostly they just leave their scat.  If you see piles of bear plop in the middle of a trail, theres a good reason, and you should probably watch your six. ',0),(604,'allenahansen','So did I read correct that you have met Hunter S Thompson?   If so What was your impression of him?','That the human body can survive more pharmaceutical assault than you ever thought possible. ',0),(605,'allenahansen','Your plastic surgeon did a wonderful job. Can we see a pic of you before the attack to put along with the current photo of you?','This was taken a month before the attack: http://i.imgur.com/uw38GaT.jpg',0),(606,'allenahansen','Bear, do you even *train*?','LOL',0),(607,'allenahansen',' Has that optimism stuck with you in the years since?','More just a niggling sense of wtf.  Life can go seriously weird on you sometimes, you know?  But it helps if you dont take it too seriously.',0),(608,'allenahansen','Do you carry a gun or at least pepper spray now?','Nope.  Just a big dog, or horse,',0),(609,'allenahansen','What was going through your mind as it was gnawing at your head   Were you accepting, horrified, strangely calm? ?','I was more pissed off than you can possible imagine thinking of all the pleasure my grizzly death would give the rednecks back in town. ',0),(610,'allenahansen','If someone were to make a movie about your experience, ala 127 hrs. Who would you pick to play you?','Me. Im sui generis. ',0),(611,'NickOfferman','Whats your favorite thing about each of the cast members of Parks and Rec?   Do you worry that youre going to be defined by this role for some time?','Amy - Her ability to combine mischief with leadership and generosity of spirit.  Adam - His sweet, gumdrop caboose.  Pratt - Best personality ever, like a golden lab meets Don Knotts. Also a fine backside.  Rashida - Incredibly well-adjusted and lovely for having been bitten by Michael Jacksons monkey as a child. Not a euphemism.  Aziz - He can say anything in the most hilarious way - also keepin them buns tight.  Aubrey - She is beautiful and wonderful - not evil, dont be ridiculous.  Rob - A champion in every way, super funny - wouldnt mind a tad more junk in his trunk.  Retta - Could rule the world if she so chose. DISCERNING. Beautiful.  As far as typecasting, I honestly dont really give a shit. I feel pretty damn lucky to have landed in the role of Ron, and if I am defined that way, well, I can think of worse problems. If no one will hire me after Ron then Ill have to suffer through making things in my shop, performing live theater, and paddling my canoe with my wife. Yes, that was a euphemism.  ',0),(612,'NickOfferman','Nick, I watched in awe your web video in which you built a canoe and must say that its quite impressive. My question is simple, whats your favorite type of wood to work with, and why?','Its difficult to name a favorite wood. They are all so noble, each with its own special characteristics.  Oak is mighty and dense, for the hull of your square-rigged sailing ship, but also, when quarter-sawn, its medullary rays can make your library table sing with erudition. Maple and Birch are creamy and many colored, like a delicious bowl of only Lucky Charms marshmallows. Cedar and Redwood are lightweight but extremely high in tensile strength, rendering them perfect for boatbuilding in the smaller classes of watercraft. Bamboo (a grass) makes natures bong. Walnut (esp. California Claro) is my gold standard for depth of figure, strength, beauty, and workability. Ash and Hickory, straight-grained and true, make excellent bludgeons, dandy for the cudgeling of vegetarians.',0),(613,'NickOfferman','I know you and your character have a lot things in common, in what ways are you drastically different from Ron?','I wouldnt call it drastic, but my penis is 5/8  larger than Rons, in both length AND breadth, but it is held that he wields his with greater aplomb.',0),(614,'NickOfferman','Whats going on here?','My wife is just apeshit for grapes. We had just done a 3 week tour of Vienna, Bruges, and Prague, over Christmastime, and every day in these venerated European cities, in a picturesque town square, centuries old, I would purchase a 12-inch pork sausage, some variety of Bratwurst, and wolf it down, muttering my adoration of Europe all the while. If your math is sound, thats about 21 linear feet of pork sausage, 1 1/4  in diameter on average. Then I was reminded that I had a naked photo shoot in NY upon the day of our return. I laughed from deep in my pork-lined belly, long and loud. It was worth it.',0),(615,'NickOfferman','  * How much of *Parks and Recreation* is improvised?   * When did you first meet Amy Poehler, and how *awesome* is she in real life?','Too many questions. That looks like a fine camp at Coachella, one in which I would like to consume intoxicants. A small portion of P&amp;R is improvised, although we have a lot freedom to spout off as we see fit. The thing is, the writing is so sublime, there is seldom any need to improve upon it. We do love to play, so we always start having extra improv fun in the later takes. I met Amy in the early 90s and she is like a superhero mixed with both Coach and Tammie Taylor from FNL, as well as Tim Riggins and a little Landry.',0),(616,'NickOfferman','Whats a typical evening at home like with Megan?','Oh, gosh. Well, we get dressed up as Marx Brothers (shes always Groucho or Harpo, and Im Chico.whatever, she made the outfits.) and we get sauced on Gin and goofballs and run around the yard, sometimes with a lot of horn-honking, and then I set up the target rings at which Megan fires ping-pong balls and sometimes racquet balls from her vagina, often racking up an impressive tally of points (she got a 420 last night!), while I assemble my black powder muzzle-loader collection and fire lead balls at our neighbor, Charlie Sheens secret wifes moms jungle cats (I miss on purpose, Im not a dick.) Normal Hollywood shit.',0),(617,'NickOfferman','Do you have any advice for someone who is just getting started in woodworking?   Especially one who cant seem to cut a straight line even with a table saw with a fence?','Maybe check out pottery?  Totally just joshing, JMWTech. Take your time and keep practicing, as with any discipline. I recommend FineWoodWorking magazine, where you can read about how to tune up your table saw. Maybe its the fence and not you. Once you get started, its all pretty simple, it just takes practice. Finding a local class is a good idea, or a local geezer, or even kid, who knows his/her way around a shop. Woodworking is a largely isolated pursuit, but its very gratifying to do it communally, whilst AROUND other woodworkers, so you can all put your heads together when one person has a puzzle to solve. I love puzzles. I love my community of woodworkers, both in my shop in LA, in NY, and all of my new pals from the world of Fine Woodworking Magazine across the country and AROUND THE WORLD.',0),(618,'NickOfferman',' Being so deadpan, how often do you crack or cause others to crack while delivering lines?','I will never defeat Aubrey in any contest, because, quite simply, she employs black magicks in her combat, which some would call unfair or  morally bankrupt , but I would never cast such a aspersion, for fear of her macabre retribution. Aubrey is kin to the Black Goat Mother of a Thousand Young, yea, she has known the spoor of Shub-Niggurath, and upon the black midnight of her birth, every blossom of the pretty little Gilly flowers perished all across Trafalgar Square. Up jumped the Devil, and off they crept. In short, she is League with Lucifer, but I really respect her work.',0),(619,'NickOfferman','What about woodworking appeals most to you?  Do you woodwork with friends?','The moments of truth in woodworking:   1) When you flood your finished wood with oil, and the grain, color and figure jump out like a visual lung-full of opium smoke (so Ive read).  2) When the piece you have wrought comes into use. The canoe, the table, the canoe paddle, the pipe, the cribbage board.. when you rest your steak and your whiskey upon the table you have made, you feel pretty goddamn tall for keeping those treats off the ground..',0),(620,'NickOfferman',' What is your morning routine that begins a day of badassery?    Also, what is your favorite outdoor activity?','I awaken. I consume oxygen, then bacon, eggs and black coffee, then my wife, then bacon.  I love to paddle my own canoe, and also wife. Best while staring at the leaves of the maple or sycamore.',0),(621,'NickOfferman','Do you and Aziz do anything weird together?','Hm. Sometimes we pretend were on a CSI program and examine each others underpants under a huge Sherlock Holmes magnifying glass..we like to go around the lot where we shoot and see whose pets heads we can fit in our mouths (I always win with Jim Belushis (miniature) Corgi), but no, nothing weird comes to mind. Oh, we both really love to enact Rush Limbaugh radio vomit with hand-puppets made from pig intestines, which is hilarious good fun, but I think a lot of people do that. On the coasts, anyway. So, no.',0),(622,'NickOfferman','How much can your mustache bench press?','114 lbs. of wife.',0),(623,'NickOfferman','You, Clint Eastwood, and Teddy Roosevelt have a bacon eating contest. Who wins?','Teddy is no longer with us, so a moment of silence for #26. You had a hell of a run, Theodore. Then, I handily defeat Clint, since he is an old - oh, wait, he pulls out a gun and shoots me, drooling something about Commies and pinko faggots and his cold, dead fingers, before falling out of his chair and soiling himself. Thanks a lot, lazythinker.',0),(624,'NickOfferman','How do you keep a happy relationship with Megan for so many years?  How should a lady be treated?','We keep a happy relationship by respecting it. We make it the top priority in our lives. A lady should be treated like any person, man or woman, with respect and good manners. If youre a fellow, it doesnt hurt to open a door for a lady, or help her with her parcels. Were all in this together.',0),(625,'NickOfferman','Howd you get started with  Nick Offerman reads tweets from young female celebraties ?','I am a very big fan of Conan,  so I am tickled anytime I get to go play with him and his gang. An incredibly funny chap named Brian Stack, who has been writing for Conan for about 15 years, thought up the idea, and he makes it happen. Just happy to do my part.',0),(626,'NickOfferman','Best way to cook Bacon &amp; Eggs?','In an iron skillet, over a fire of oak at your cabin.',0),(627,'NickOfferman','When you play monopoly, which piece do you choose to represent you on the board, and why?','I choose the thimble because no matter where I roam, you cant prick my motherfuckin thumb with your bitch-ass Scottie Dog.

Should I have come over and said hi?','Thats a goddamn lie.',0),(629,'NickOfferman',' Since I assume its all natural, what do you do in episodes where part of it needs to be burned off (Lil Sebastians funeral is on TV now) or removed for some reason?   Do you actually have to mangle it and wait for it to grow back before you shoot another episode, or is there some kind of makeup trick to get that effect while still preserving the moustaches integrity?','My moustache grows with such rampant, perpetual virility, that we need to trim it 3 or 4 times a day during filming. It was cool at first (grade school), but to be honest, its getting old.',0),(630,'NickOfferman','living in Chicago during the mid-90s; did you ever feel like joining the then-popular improv scene?','No, I did not. The comedy world and the  straight theatre  were very self-contained, very autonomous groups, and I was in 100% ignorance to that fecund chuckle-field. I was working on plays, mostly with my company, The Defiant Theatre, 24/7, so it was all I could do to see another play that a friend was in, let alone go see comedy.',0),(631,'NickOfferman','How much action does your mustache see?  Is it more than you actually see yourself?','If by  action , you mean  the puss , Id say that is not for public consumption, either literally or figuratively. The rumors that my moustache has a burgeoning career in Japanese porn are almost entirely unfounded. As far as I know.',0),(632,'NickOfferman','  Is there any truth to the stories about you at family dinners, refusing to eat your tuna casserole, which always ended in you  crying like a little bitch ?','I have no sister. After that bit of whistle-blowing.

I do so enjoy the normal Laphroaig, especially getting my Dad to pronounce it after a couple of snorts. Hes a lot of fun with Cabernet Sauvingon as well.',0),(635,'NickOfferman','On a one on one fight you against Theodore Roosevelt at your age, who would win and why?','Ted Roosevelt would hand me my ass in moments. He was a goddamn man and soldier who could kill with his hands. Lets remember, I am an actor who is handy with a sopkeshave. Spokeshave. Apologies, Shakers.',0),(636,'NickOfferman',' How did you get involved with those guys, and how easy is it for you to accommodate dropping by that set to shoot a scene/episode at any given time?','CH is my favorite show for envelope-pushing on the air right now. Rob Corddry is so delightfully, wickedly funny, and his writers and cast are unstoppable. He contacted me to play Briggs after we had worked in a film together, now called Taking Chances, and we enjoyed placing our fingers inside each others mouths.',0),(637,'NickOfferman','Whats your favorite firearm?','The Trebouchet?',0),(638,'NickOfferman','Have you ever eaten a turf n turf?','Have you ever eaten a fatal amount of beef?

Amy and Pratt and Aubrey and Aziz and Adam and Rob and Rashida and Retta. Every single cast member. Devastatingly funny.',0),(641,'NickOfferman','favorite scene to be a part of on parks and rec?','Any scene. If I am on the call sheet, it is my favoritest.

Is it a direct connection to a station on the ground or does it bounce off of NASA/Russian/ESA satellites?   * What are the connection speeds like?  Ping time?    * Can you use Skype or other  mainstream  sites/applications?   And a random question:  * what part of Earth are you over right now?','My laptop here onboard communicates to a server in Houston via satellite relay, and that server on the ground is hooked through a computer to the internet. The data rate is very slow, not fast enough to watch video, but perfect for things like Reddit and Twitter. We have the data link about half the time.  No Skype, but when we have the right communications links I can directly access the internet in Mission Control, Houston, and Tweet and do this AMA real-time. We have that link many times, every day.

Well go to the Moon in person again as soon as weve learned all we can on ISS, and have solid, reliable engines to take us there and back.   Can you invent those engines? You have an entire life to do it in. Then you could ride them, and stand on another world.',0),(710,'ColChrisHadfield',' What is the temperature on ISS?

If an electric razor, how do you keep the bits of hair from floating all over the place and getting breathed in?  Any chance youll put together a coffee table book when you get back?  How is your family doing?   Nervous still, or relaxed at this point?','We can adjust the temp, but we keep it comfortable room temp, good for working out and living, sleeping.  No coffee table book planned, but you never know :)  I shave with cream and a standard multi-blade, just wipe it on a cloth every time, works fine  My family is fine - in fact my son Evan is helping support my social media, and taught me how to use Reddit.

',0),(711,'ColChrisHadfield','Any advice to a young person who wants to get into this field?','Decide in your heart of hearts what really excites and challenges you, and start moving your life in that direction. Every decision you make, from what you eat to what you do with your time tonight, turns you into who you are tomorrow, and the day after that. Look at who you want to be, and start sculpting yourself into that person. You may not get exactly where you thought youd be, but you will be doing things that suit you in a profession you believe in. Dont let life randomly kick you into the adult you dont want to become. ',0),(712,'ColChrisHadfield',' What do you think NASA, other space agencies and astronauts need to do to keep people informed and interested in the science of space exploration?','Theres always positive and negative. We lost a crew early in Apollo, and the last 2 Moon landings were cancelled even though the rockets were built. Skylab decayed and fell from the sky before the Shuttle could be made ready to fly.   Weve endured accidents, budget cycles, and many naysayers. But meanwhile we have accomplished countless acts of magnificence, from walking on the Moon to Hubble teaching us about the universe, to international cooperation, to Curiosity drilling on Mars, to permanently leaving Earth on ISS.   Im working as hard as I can to help that all happen, and have been for 20 years. Its hard to leave home, but were managing to do it as a species, regardless. Pretty amazing. ',0),(713,'ColChrisHadfield','What do you think the next step for space exploration should be?  Do you think sending a manned mission back to the moon to establish a moon base is feasible at this point?','As a species, we have always taken the very best of our technology and used it to take us to the furthest reaches of our knowledge - the horse, the wheel, the sailing ship, steamship, propellor, jet, rocket, Space Station. Yes, we will establish a permanent base on the Moon and beyond, but when depends on inventions not yet made.   My guess is that power generation is the primary obstacle, and fossil fuels and even solar power wont be enough. Meanwhile, the Space Station is the crucible where space exploration technology is designed and tested. When we go further out, it will be heavily indebted to the pedigree of space hardware proven on ISS. ',0),(714,'ColChrisHadfield','  * What is your opinion on the privatization of space?  * What is your favorite experiment that youre working on right now?','Privatization is the right and natural way to go, and we are on the cusp of it now. We have a Space X Dragon coming to ISS in 2 weeks, well grab it with Canadarm2.  My favorite experiment is [BCAT](http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/bcatc1.asp) - looking at the behaviour of nanoparticles and structures and how they form without the weight of gravity.',0),(715,'ColChrisHadfield',' Assuming that wasnt actually you did you notice any activity from your vantage point?','We didnt see the meteorite that did all the damage in Russia, as we were on the other side of the Earth. But I see small ones burn up between ISS and the earth every day. ',0),(716,'ColChrisHadfield',' My question is: How hard is to sleep out there in space?    What would happen if any of you get appendicities or tooth pain or any other pain?','I love sleeping weightless. No mattress, no pillow, no sore shoulder, no hot spots. Just relax every muscle in your body and drift off to sleep.   Im trained as an EMT, and Tom is a doctor, plus we have a basic pharmacy onboard. If it were really bad, wed get in our Soyuz and return to Earth. ',0),(717,'ColChrisHadfield','And the most embarrassing?','During my 2nd spaceflight, while doing a live National TV News broadcast, I forgot the name of the Space Shuttle Commander. He always went by his nickname of Rommel, and to come up with Kent Rominger somehow escaped me. Instead, I said Ken Cameron, the CDR of my 1st flight. Oops. ',0),(718,'ColChrisHadfield','Have you done any space walks?   If so, what was it like?','I was Canadas first spacewalker, doing 2 to help build the mighty Canadarm2 robot onto ISS. It was the most magnificent experience of my life. Alone in a 1-person spaceship (my suit), just holding on with my 1 hand, with the bottomless black universe on my left and the World pouring by in technicolor on my right. I highly recommend it. ',0),(719,'ColChrisHadfield','Which part of the world looks the coolest from space?','Australia looks coolest - the colours and textures of the Outback are severly artistic. The most beautiful to me are the Bahamas, the vast glowing reefs of every shade of blue that exists. ',0),(720,'ColChrisHadfield','  How long did it take you to not get lost inside the space station?  What is one experiment you are helping with that you really like?','I never get lost in the Space Station, but I often have to look around to decide which way I want to use as up right now. Maybe this is how fish and spiders feel.   I did a Japanese art experiment to view the world in floating drops of water, and make HD video of it. It was fun and beautiful. ',0),(721,'ColChrisHadfield','  Do you hear them hit?   What about things like the solar panels?','Sometimes we hear pings as tiny rocks hit our spaceship, and also the creaks and snaps of expanding metal as we go in and out of sunlight. The solar panels are full of tiny holes from the micro-meteorites. ',0),(722,'ColChrisHadfield','What is the scariest thing you have seen whilst in space?','I watched a large meteorite burn up between me and Australia, and to think of that hypersonic dumb lump of rock randomly hurtling into us instead sent a shiver up my back. ',0),(723,'ColChrisHadfield',' I have a couple questions:  1) Do you conduct science on the ISS every day?  Or are there rest days?   2) What is the biggest danger you face while living in space?   3) Do you think vacationing in space will become a reality for the average person?   If so, when?','We conduct science every day, but are lighter-loaded on Sat/Sun.  The biggest danger is launch - all that power and acceleration. Once we survive that, its just a steady threat of radiation, meteorite impacts, and vehicle system failure like fire or ammonia breakthrough.   We need better engines for spaceflight to be safer and simpler, and thus cheaper. Like the difference to cross the Atlantic in a prop vs a jet airplane. ',0),(724,'ColChrisHadfield','  My question: what does space smell like?  Is your sense of smell altered at all being up there?','The vacuum of space has no smell, but when we come in from a spacewalk the airlock smells like ozone, or gunpowder. It likely comes from the gentle offgassing of the outer metal and fabric of our suits. ',0),(725,'ColChrisHadfield','If you discover intelligent life, who should play you in the movie?','Someone with a good moustache. ',0),(726,'ColChrisHadfield','Have you ever considered organising a mutiny, deorbiting the ISS and sailing the infinite void of space?','Those are several bad ideas :) Were here for a pretty pure purpose, on behalf of everyone else. Keeps mutinies to a minimum. ',0),(727,'ColChrisHadfield','My 10yo son asks:   Do you need special computers to work up there?','We have special computers that run the spaceship, yes, but they are based on normal Earth computers.

It makes me smile to myself, every time. ',0),(730,'ColChrisHadfield','Hi Chris, tell us a bit about the song you recorded with Ed Robertson of the Barenaked Ladies, ISS Is Somebody Singing?  Which lines did you write?  And is there a place for us to download the song?','I wrote the 1st version of the song, Ed used a bunch of my ideas for the main lyric and came up with that awesome melody, I wrote the 2nd verse, Ed chose the bridge. We worked together, and Ed is just a wonderful Canadian guy. I really like what we did, and the Coalition for Music Education is doing a lot of good for young Canadians with it.  ',0),(731,'ColChrisHadfield','In your opinion, what space exploration missions should be given priority?','The ones that the taxpayers want. My job is to perform them as efficiently and creatively as I can, like what Im doing today, and during these 5 months.',0),(732,'ColChrisHadfield','* What time zone do you live by?  Do you switch off the lights at  night ?','We live on Greenwich time, UTC, same as London England. We shut of most lights at bedtime - it feels right to do it. ',0),(733,'ColChrisHadfield','How long did it take you to learn how to maneuver in zero gravity?  Are you much better at it now than when you originally came aboard the ISS?','Im still learning! But sometimes now, I am graceful.

Im teaching the Level 1s at my squadron soon, is there anything you would to tell them about the program and your experiences in it?','Air Cadets in Canada is a superb program for people between 13 and 18. It taught me self disipline, leadership and how to fly, and directly laid the groundwork for where I am floating today. Per Ardua Ad Astra.',0),(735,'ColChrisHadfield',' Why is that?  And can we expect this to be the norm going forward?','Each astronaut has personal goals as part of their career. One of mine has been education and public awareness of what we are doing in space exploration. This current 5-month mission combined with the advent of social media has made this possible like never before. I think it is important that people see the world from this new perspective that technology has given us, and I do my utmost to make that happen. ',0),(736,'ColChrisHadfield',' ?  (Side question: Do you actually do it?','At first, yes, but after a few days, you start to see the whole world as one place. An awesome perspective to be given. ',0),(737,'ColChrisHadfield',' Im an electrician so I was wondering do you have an astronaut that is an electrician as well or just highly trained?  Do you guys have breaker panels or fuses?   What about the power generation, how often do you change the batteries?  What happens if 1 panel in an array goes out?','We are trained to be able to do everything onboard - we have to be. It takes many years.   Station has many levels of current protection, circuit breakers inside and out, most that can be reset remotely.   Our solar panels are big and powerful, and we have enough taht we can lose some and still power everything. ',0),(738,'ColChrisHadfield','How much privacy do you and the rest of the astronauts get while aboard the ISS?','Im typing now in my Sleep Station, a small padded room with a door, completely private, like a bedroom without the bed, and phone booth sized.

Also, what is your favorite thing youve ever witnessed first hand (be it captured on camera or not)?','My favourite picture is of noctilucent cloud - to me it is both beautiful and scientific. I never thought Id even see those rare phenomena, let alone get a top-notch photo of them.  You can see the photo [here](https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/287978095405838336).',0),(742,'ColChrisHadfield','Ever listen to Space Oddity while you are up there?','Yes, I love Bowie, and Ive been singing and playing that song. Changed the words a bit, though, so Major Tom has a happier ending. ',0),(743,'ColChrisHadfield','Whats your favourite space food?','I have a new one - lemon curd cake.

Truly see our world.

We maneuver the Space Station out of the way when NORAD tells us debris may come too close to us. ',0),(746,'ColChrisHadfield','   Do you ever feel like you lack privacy up there?  How do you deal with that?','Privacy here is about the same as how I grew up - one of five kids in a farmhouse. Its never a problem.

Some things come back quicker, but bones and muscles take time to truly recover.

A fantastic continuous light show as we swing north and south, just shimmering and dancing there, demanding to be stared at. ',0),(780,'johnfogerty','  What did you learn - if anything - from this experience?   Do you think the case had any merit?','Came to trial in 1988. This is a complicated story and Ill try to explain it even tho it gets weirder when I try to type it. I really dont think the case had merit. For instance, when my album Centerfield first came out, I heard a rumor that Fantasy was going to sue me, but at first they were talking about the song Green River. Later they changed their mind to Run Through the Jungle. Seemed they were searching to find something they owned that sounded similar to The Old Man Down the Road. Obviously I finally ended up in a courtroom where I sang a little of both songs and showed how my style on the guitar evolved, making many of the things I do sound similar musically  Every artist in the world actually spends a lifetime hoping he will find  a style.  That is a style. A musical style. If youre lucky enough to find one, it means you are instantly recognizable to the listener. Byt he way, the case was, I believe, really clear when Fantasys musical expert played a computerized version of each song with a series of beeps coming out of the speaker. He explained that if the songs were the same, you would only hear one note at the song. If you heard two beeps at the same time, the melodies werent the same. As weve now come to learn in our internet world where you click the button and there it goes, the man in the courtroom clicked the button. Three notes - same melody. Rest of the way was 2 beeps. I chuckled to myself cause the man had blown his own case. Proved the songs were not similar, but uniquely different.  I didnt argue the case in front of the Supreme Court. There was argued my right to get my attorneys fees back. Wasnt built in uniquely in cases like this. The deck was really stacked against me and all songwriters. Fact that they made that ruling is very important for songwriters from now on. Vote was 11-0.',0),(781,'johnfogerty',' Was there anyone you wanted to have on the new record, but couldnt?  Do you ever get tired of playing CCR songs after all these years?  If you had to choose three songs to represent your career, what would those songs be and why?','1. Yes, but I dont want to reveal who they might be. There were a few. I think it would be unfair to reveal cause it was mostly about scheduling. These are artists I really love, and you never know - maybe Ill get to cross paths with those mystery guests sometime in the future.   2. Well the actual complete answer is, for a long time I didnt play my early CCR hits because of so much bad feeling between myself and the original record company and also with the other members of CCR. It was a very complicated and confusing and hurtful state of affairs for me. So after meeting my beautiful wife Julie and falling deeply in love and also in love with life in general, my heart re-imbraced that music for all the right reasons, starting with the fact that I had written all these songs in the first place. I am now able to have a very strong affection for this music I created. i love singing Proud Mary, Born on the Bayou, I love singing Have You Ever Seen the Rain with an audience. Its one of the great joys of being a musician, to share that experience with an audience.  3. First song I would choose is Joy of My Life, because - I know things like this get a little corny to some people, but its not corny to me. Im the guy thats living it. In so many profound ways, Im just grateful my heart was reclaimed by Miss Julie. Second I would have to say Proud Mary amazingly because at the time I wrote it, I just knew it was a really great song. Theres a connection there I cant really explain. Theres some kind of mystical knowledge I was given almost like clairvoyance, to see the future even tho I was still living on $20 a week. For some reason, God let me realize this thing was far above what I had ever done before, and someone that everything was gonna turn out OK. Im sure glad he didnt tell me it was gonna take 40 years! If I had to pick a third, its a tie between Mystic Highway and Train of Fools. I really enjoy MH for many reasons. In some way, I have the same feeling I did about Proud Mary. Dont know why this song landed on me like this but Im sure glad it did. At the same time, if this was the olden days, the B side would have been Train of Fools. I must admit the visceral side of me really loves Train of Fools - how it sounds, soulful way its played, dark mystery of lyrics. It happens to be one of those songs I played in my car for weeks after it was finally done. Hate to admit I do that sort of thing cause I usually dont, but Train of Fools was so rock n roll. I love that song.',0),(782,'johnfogerty',' Im a guitarist, and ive always been curious how you got that amazing tone for many of your CCR songs?','Tone - wow. You spend a lifetime thinking about tone, worrying about tone. I realize here I am probably being a guitar geek and so I may have a selective audience who even worries about this part. I was very lucky back in the day things were still analog, not digital. I formed my values early on from the correct realm. Im sure youve all heard other artists rant about how digital sucks the life and tone out of their music, and in some ways thats true. I grew up loving the great tone of people like Duane Eddy, Bo Diddley, Chet Atkins, Lowman Pauling from the group The Five Royals. Give yourself a treat - go look up the Five Royals and play these three songs - Think, Dont Let it Be in Vain, and most notably Slummer the Slum. You will have trouble sleeping until you figure those out. Basically, my answer about tone is the simpler, the better. I love to plug in a great guitar, which already sounds good, into a great amp. A handwired point-to-point amp. Vintage  snob, boutique  amps you can get nowadays. Summing it up - first time I picked up a Les Paul custom guitar in Albany, CA, plugged it in to a Fender Blackface Amp (A twin? maybe a deluxe) in 1969, I think February.. I tuned the guitar down to D, kind of like in Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising. I played one E chord which came out as a D chord. I believe I was on the bridge pickup. The sound that came out was the opening chord of Midnight Special. Even to this day, when I play that chord live in front of an audience, I always take a moment to revel in how great that sounds. The red seas have parted.',0),(783,'johnfogerty','If you were to write a  Fortunate Son  for today, what would it be about?','My starting point is actually in the second verse. Its an age old struggle and unfortunately its still with us. Something that probably bothers me more about life in this world and anything else is wealthy, privileged, spoiled rich people have so much power. All you have to do is look at Wall Street and some of the firms, big names on Wall Street, and trace some of the members of those firms directly to the White House. You realize  oh my god, theyre running things, no matter which party gets elected.  This REALLY pisses me off. I hope someday because of the iternet and fact that we can all be so connected, we are able to put a stop to that and have the common man running things. After all, there are so many more of us.',0),(784,'johnfogerty','What do you think about the song  Fortunate Son  being used on Wrangler Jean ads, where they completely change the meaning of the song (they take out the  it aint me  part)?','Hey Mr. Berger. I was really pissed off the first time I heard it, too! I think my reaction was  Oh my God, they turned my song into pants!  Heres the funny part about all of this. Back in the times I was raised, I didnt want my musical stars to be pitchmen selling products. Especially guys with a conscience - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen. you get the picture. Those guys, myself included, got lots of airplay on the radio. It seemed tawdry to be going after even more money by making commercials. So, here we are in the new millenium. Its much harder for people of my generation, including myself, to get that sort of radio airplay. Its a fact of life, the way the music industry has changed. Some actually believe that the straightest line to getting airplay is to make some sort of commercial with your song in it. Therefore, the new millenium of this brave new world, I have a much more tolerant idea about such things. Oh my god, call me a hypocrite, but I feel the day may come that I will willingly have a commercial with my song in it. By the way, so far, those songs youve heard in commercials have not happened willingly on my part. Stay tuned.',0),(785,'johnfogerty','What was your experience of Woodstock 69? com/watch?','Getting to Woodstock was an experience Ill never forget. As we got closer and closer in a helicopter from the holiday inn where we were staying, you could see cars parked on the highways abandoned for miles. Long skinny parking lots. Everyone left their cars and walked. Ive never seen that again in my life. Once on the ground, I felt a sense of trepidation. I was kinda worried that someone might yell  fire!  in a locked club. I was afraid of the prospect of people stampeding or getting anxious about something. Happily nothing like that happened. Everyone had a great time and I followed the Grateful Dead, who put half a million people to sleep. It was my job to warm them up for Janis.',0),(786,'johnfogerty','  I see that you are working with a lot of country musicians, do you always have seen yourself as a country artist?   Whatdo you think is the difference between country music and rock?   How was working with Brad Paisley? ?','Growing up, I was greatly influenced and had great admiration for many country artists. Im not sure I ever saw myself as a country artist. What I always felt I was, was pretty much a mainstream rock n roll kid growing up, listening to rock radio. In those times when I was young, rock n roll really embraced a lot of other styles of music and simply called it rock n roll. Id quote people like Carl Perkins, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Conway Twitty- there were so many that seemed to flow in from the country wing of rock n roll. But then again, lots of great artists like Ray Charles, Solomon Burke. and to be a little esoteric, Harry Belafonte, Pete Seger - these were all people who had a different take. We as the audience loved them in rock n roll. I just grew up loving good music. My own tastes were formed by these and many many more great artists. One of the parts of country Ive always admired was there seemed to be so many fabulous musicians. Sort of player who sits on his front porch and play mandolin, banjo, acoustic guitar, bluegrass kinda wild and crazy pickin on all those instruments. I wanted to grow up and be like Chet Atkins. Rock n roll began as more powerful and louder music. Somewhere in the 70s after Van Halen, who I love, rock n roll embraced technical ability and so we have many great player sin rock field now like Eddie Van Halen, Steve Vai, lots of great pickers these days. A little off track here, which brings me to present. A guy I really admire and wanted to work with is Brad Paisley. A really nice guy and fabulous guitar player. Whats amazing is he could play rock n roll, country - hes one of those artists in between those worlds. If you put a rock band behind him, he wouldnt change a thing and hed be the greatest rock player in the world. I want to grow up and be Brad Paisley.',0),(787,'johnfogerty','   I am curious as to whether the songs  Proud Mary  and  Down on the Corner  are based on real-life experiences of yours or someone you know, or were they just made up?','Hmmm. Well in the case of Proud Mary, the song kind of just landed on me. Sometimes it feels that way, as if you had just tuned a radio station in your mind correctly and some music comes through very clearly. Proud Mary was written directly after I had just been honorably discharged from the Army in 1968. It was sitting on the steps to my little apartment and was a surprise when I opened the envelope. I was so happy, at the height of Vietnam, that I turned a cartwheel on the lawn and went inside and 50 minutes later I had written Proud Mary. Boy was I happy. You may call that a real life experience but not sure what it had to do with a river and a boat.  Down on the Corner, believe it or not, was kind of inspired by seeing an advertisement in the paper one day. It was an ad from Disney that said in great big letters  Winnie the Poo.  Something in my brain said  Winnie the Poo and the Poo Boys.  Obviously that was close to  Willy and the Poor Boys.  As I began to develop this idea it turned into music in that weird mystical almost uncontrollable way music comes to songwriters. Winnie the Poo is still my favorite character who Ive shared with my daughter Kelsy since the day she was born, tho shes growing out of it. But Im not.',0),(788,'johnfogerty','  What exactly does  chooglin  mean?','It was just a fun expression that I made up. It wasnt a real word but I wanted to have a word that sounded kind of like  rockin,   shufflin,   boogie,  kind of rock n roll.',0),(789,'johnfogerty','any thoughts of politics?','I have no thoughts about being a politician. Its a thankless job. It seems the only really truthful politicians are done in pretty quickly by their cohorts, the other politicians. It seems to be reelected you have to lie to someone so you will look good to everybody and find yourself agreeing with the largest group of voters. I believe you end up losing yourself because there is so much insincerity. That said, I still go to the polls and vote because thats our privilege, our right and our duty, and Im perennially disappointed.',0),(790,'johnfogerty','Where did CCR get its sound?  What were some of your influences?','The sound of CCR was really a direct result of my musical influences. For instance, I really loved the sound of some of the country artists like Johnny Cash and many of the early Sun Records stars. I think this was probably an influence that wasnt really present in the other guys backgrounds. I also loved blues and R&amp;B, which we all shared, and some of my heroes had a bit of influence on the overall sound that I wanted to project. For instance, Bo Diddley, Carl Perkins, Hank Williams, Wilson Pickett, and of course the influence of Elvis was everywhere in rock n roll. It really hard to make a complete answer out of this question. Like most kids my age, just about anything great that happened in rock n roll I was influence by.',0),(791,'johnfogerty',' Im a big Fan, and im only 21 Have you ever seen the rain?  Where did that come from?','It was written during a very chaotic time in the life of myself and my band CCR. Literally the song is about the band breaking up. To explain it as clearly as I can, the band seemed to have arrived at a place where we had accomplished all of those amazing goals we had set for ourselves and everything should have been perfect but right at that same time, the guys in the band were voicing louder and louder their dissatisfaction with this thing or that thing, usually tiny things like why cant we each have a separate limo. It seemed to me as if you had a beautiful blue sky, Gods perfection, but at the same time it was raining down all the dissatisfaction. The amazing thing is now, when I look back, this song has a really beautiful melody. I thank God for that. It kind of landed on me. The song has taken on a new and joyful meaning for me. It is because the song reminds me of my daughter Kelsy. As you know, she is also the joy in my life. A rainbow, if you will. My song Have You Ever Seen the Rain does have a rainbow in it.',0),(792,'johnfogerty','Were there any songs you wrote where some of your band members or anyone said, no that wont ever be a success, but turned out to be a huge success?','Well, I will tell one tale out of school, I guess. I remember showing the band the song Down on the Corner. We were in the studio, now remember that song has a lot of tricky rhythmic parts. At some point, Stu Cook was frustrated with playing the bass line and he said something like  Well this isnt good. Its not even rock n roll.  Something like that. As leader of the band, therefore the general that was trying to lead his troops over the hill to victory, there was a large cartoon bubble over my head that said  Didnt come to fight, came to make a record.  I kept my mouth shut to provide support and info to get our job done. I will say in hindsight, besides that singular event, a lot of the time the guys really liked the songs I wrote. This was the general feeling until the band got to that stage where a lot of bands find themselves, where the bickering and silliness from within began to get louder than the job of making music.',0),(793,'johnfogerty','What do you feel defines America?','Do you mean then? Or now? Thats obviously the answer from an older person with a bit of nostalgia in his heart. I grew up in an America that took great pride in its ability to be the best there was in the world. I feel our citizens still feel that way in their hearts. I do believe we have our talents and our every-man sincerity squandered by our titans and tycoons of business. All you have to say is  China.  Im hoping we will re-discover that pride in workmanship, in service, in an honest days wage for an honest days work, which is the slogan we all used to live by. I do remember a time when a person who was doing a chore for you really tried hard to make the customer be first.  The customer always comes first.  Nowadays, I realize that almost sounds corny. But I really do hope we get back to those values.',0),(794,'johnfogerty',' Whats the best advice you can give on how to enter the industry in 2013?','More power to you! Believe in your dream absolutely. Go for it. Now, in all sincerity, and you may find that strange, but when you come to the point where you have bandmates and you think theyre the guys youre going to battle with in this musical skirmish if you will, try to get the things youve agreed upon in writing. I am serious about this. I had many agreements with my bandmates way back in the day. Unfortunately those agreements were not in writing. I was counting on everybodys word as a gentlemen. Unfortunately people change and they think their word can change to suit later situations. Oh man, am I sorry about that. Ok, after that disclaimer, my advice is to trust your heart, do the sort of music and material/songs you really resonate with. Dont let someone else control or thwart your dream and your vision. Take advice when you can, but be true to yourself.',0),(795,'johnfogerty','Hi, John - the new album is fantastic! Train of Fools  is just the latest among many excellent songs youve written about trains - have you had a lifelong interest in them, or are you just attracted to the imagery they evoke?','Ive had a lifelong interest in trains. I cant really explain it, but there just seems to be something very American about them. At least, some connection to American history. When I was quite young, I remember I was stopped at a railroad crossing and a train was coming. My dad talked about the trin and said something like  Son, trains like that are disappearing quickly and wont be any more like that.  Talkin about a steam engine from the 1800s. We were in Montana at the time. Must have been an extraordinary train to see with my father. Trains also represent some mystical escape. ',0),(796,'johnfogerty','Hello big fan here, which artist did you enjoy most to cooperate with on your new album?','That answer changes by the minute. When Im listening to Proud Mary, I remember the wonderful day I had with Jennifer and Allen Toussaint and the New Orleans musicians. Almost Saturday Night - great time with dear friend Keith Urban. When I listen to Fortunate Son, remember incredible experience recording and playing live with the Foos. So much fun. Its a matter of who Im thinking about at the time. This album was truly a joyful experience, wonderful learning experience for me, and Im quite certain something Im gonna remember for a long long time.',0),(797,'iamrogerfederer','  * Whats your opinion about moving up to a 95 sq in racquet like most of the ATP?   * Do you follow any of the nutritional/training advances that players like Djokovic have adopted in recent years?  (pressure chamber, low carb diet)  * Would you ever consider changing huge variables in your game such as Agassi did in the second phase of his career, and go for broke, or are you okay with sticking to the game plan for as long as possible?   * What is your opinion about some in the French quarters, notably Yannick Noah, who have accused Spaniards of doping?   *  And lastly, on a more personal note- many of us here in Miami were devastated you decided to opt out of Sony Ericsson tournament this past year- would you ever consider alternating attendance between Indian Wells &amp; Sony Ericsson?','1. Ive been testing rackets for the last 10 years and have also tested 95 sq so who knows. Maybe one day. Im always open for changes. The real challenge is finding a time in the calendar year where i have enough time to test it out and get comfortable.  2. Its important to do everything in moderation. I live a really healthy lifestyle already. As an athlete I do spend a lot of time to make sure im eating the right things at the right time but as I get older I definitely and paying more attention to my nutrition. Sleep is always important. So is treatment. ',0),(798,'iamrogerfederer','  Since players like you, Nadal, or Djokovic have all started off as young players, what advice do you have for young tennis players who have dreams of going professional?','Take up Football. No just kidding.  #1 You have to enjoy what youre doing.   Its not always easy but it sure is a whole lot of fun traveling the world, meeting people, learning different cultures and playing against other great people and players. For that, you need to work really hard and play tough and fair. And learn from your losses and your disappointments and make sure you dont look back with regrets.',0),(799,'iamrogerfederer',' How do you deal with nerves before a match?  Is there anything special, or is it all training?  Or perhaps something else?','Funny enough I could be more nervous about a 2nd round match than a finals match from time to time. Just because you have more doubts on certain days. Unexplainable really. But of course when the big matches roll around you have tendency to be more anxious. I dont really have any specific routines other than having my normal pre-match routine which helps me get comfortable and focused. ',0),(800,'iamrogerfederer','What do you think is the biggest plus about Switzerland, besides the flag?','Its one of the most beautiful countries Ive ever seen. So worthwhile to visit.

I clearly would love more tournaments on grass :)  Lets not forget 3 of the 4 grand slams used to be on grass.',0),(804,'iamrogerfederer','What are some of your pre-match rituals?','1. Arrive on time at the courts. Pretty crucial so I dont miss my match. 2. Warmup and hit for 30min. 3. Go for lunch or dinner. A light meal (pasta, for instance) 4. Get my ankles taped.  5. Stretch. 6. Warm up and match time.',0),(805,'iamrogerfederer',' What are your feelings on carpet as a playing surface?  Do you wish carpet would make a return to the ATP Tour?

Can we make this happen?','I was probably 5 years old when my mother saw a commercial on television, and she had this thought that it would be fun for me to do commercials, because I had (and have) a lot of energy. She felt like it was a good outlet for me. So (this was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa) - there really wasnt much of an outlet for that kind of vocation, so she enrolled me in a modeling school that had an acting element to it. I ended up doing some local runway modeling. to make a long story short, the school ended up taking some of its clients out to California for the International Modeling &amp; Talent Convention. So my brother (whos seven years older than me - he was already doing drama and musicals in school) and I went out to that together - it was my first time to Los Angeles, which was mindblowing. I remember being fascinated by the palm trees from the plane as we were landing. And it was there that I met the man who became my manager. He stopped me in the lobby of the Biltmore hotel and asked if I had ever thought or was interested in being an actor, and I remember responding  yes! that sounds fun.  Shortly thereafter, my brother, mother and I moved out to Los angeles for pilot season, to audition - and after 6 weeks of auditioning (*I got a commercial agent too), I got my first job, which was a Paula Abdul music video, for  Forever your Girl.  Which, consequently, I later found out was directed by David Fincher before he started making movies. So that was kind of it - I had that first experience, I did a number of commercials after it, and it was later that year that I got my first role in a film, which was a small role in  Back to the Future II.  Which was mindblowing to a 8 year old.   The moment in my career - I feel like Ive had a lot of those experiences. It was incredibly surreal being onstage with a number of the case members and Peter Jackson accepting the award for Best Picture at the Oscars. You dont ever imagine that youll be in that scenario. Hosting SNL was a similar, surreal experience - a show that I grew up watching, and I was petrified at the notion of hosting, and I found myself loving it. I have to say my life has been blessed with many experiences I never imagine I would have, and not even all of them relating to the movie industry.  The new season of WILFRED - we definitely focus on the origin and the mystery that is the childhood drawing. And we address my issues with my father a bit more, and I think (from what I can tell of the experience making this season), it will be the funniest season, because I dont remember ever having laughed as much.  For the podcast, private message me and Ill forward it to my publicist.   ',0),(829,'iamElijahWood',' What horror movie has genuinely disturbed you and stuck with you the longest?

I found MARTYRS very disturbing, its a French horror film. Its brutal, and I love the film, but its hard to watch.  2.) I wish! Ive had potentially ambiguous / benign experiences where I thought I heard my name whispered as I was falling asleep - actually, I have one story. I was sitting in the backhouse of my familys last home and I heard the backdoor to the main house open and shut. And I sat up, and waited, because the only person that was in the main house was my sister, so I assumed that in seconds my door was going to open and my sister was going to be there. And that timing went by, and no one came to the door, so I picked up the phone to call the main house, and I pressed talk, and there was no dial-tone, because my sister was trying to call me at exactly the same time, because she had thought that I had opened the door to go into the main house. And we both simultaneously said * Was that you? *  It freaked us out. Hannah was more concerned that it might be an intruder in the house than I was, and we checked the perimeter of the  house and there was no one around, but it was so clear that we had both thought the other of us had opened and shut the door.

I didnt know much about Mardi Gras prior to that, and it really is an extraordinary way to experience that festival and New Orleans - and all of it I was experiencing for the first time. Totally overwhelming, but extremely exciting, riding on a float through the city and throwing dubloons with my face on them and beads at people. A number of my friends came and were on the float with me, it was a pretty magical trip. And then getting to return as Prince to Sean Astins king was great because I actually as a result didnt have any of the responsibility does - its actually a quite intense schedule for the King, so as prince, I got to enjoy all the same fun experiences without having quite so much responsibility.  2.) Well, I still get nervous for auditions. I dont know if that will make you feel any better. I find that sometimes, if I articulate that Im a little nervous, it helps. I also find that to find a comfort zone for myself by communicating - just having a chat with people in the room prior to actually getting into the audition part helps. To just talk about something else and relate to them as people - it humanizes the experience, and takes it away from being a judgement hou.  Recommendations -  *  Goat - WORLD MUSIC *  Tame Impala - LONERISM *  The Brand New Wayo compilation *  The new Boards of Canada record *  Obviously, the new Daft Punk record RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES *  The Orb and Lee Scratch Perry released an album together',0),(831,'iamElijahWood','Elijah, have you ever dealt with depression or similar adversities?  If you have, how did you pull through it?','I cant say that Ive dealt with depression, because I think thats a really heavy thing, and I think that people sometimes use that word really lightly in reference to being blue or depressed. So no, Ive not dealt with depression, but I deal with anxiety on a minor level. Its something that Ive had most of my life, and it never manifests on an uncontrollable level with panic attacks, its just more reflective of a sensitivity to everything around me. Most of the time, I just accept it or try to understand what Im feeling anxious about, and work through it - sometimes if Im nervous, I talk about it, and that helps. You know, all you can do is sort of ride it out, because sometimes it has a mind of its own. Also I tell myself that its manifested out of my mind and emotions - I think a real understanding that I came to about anxiety specifically is created by what youre sort of unconciously telling yourself. ',0),(832,'iamElijahWood','What is the horror movie that has most influenced you?   What other movies are you producing on the horizon?','Oh man. what most influenced me. I think the horror movie that looms most in my mind is HALLOWEEN. I dont know that that movie influenced me, but I think it was a horror film that I saw relatively early in my horror consumption that I feel is an incredibly influential film, and where I was able to see to a certain degree what you can do with the genre at a higher level.  So theres a film called A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT, which is an Iranian vampire film shot in B&amp;W and in Farsi, thats in post-production right now. We are about to shoot a movie called COOTIES, about a zombie virus that affects children pre-puberty and a group of teachers who are stuck in an elementary school (and that was written by Leigh Whannell and Ian Brennan; Leigh wrote SAW and Ian created GLEE, so it should be an interesting combination). And we have a film that we picked up last year while we were programming our horror film festival called NIGHTMARE CITY with Cinefamily called TOAD ROAD, which is a documentary that weaves in a horror narrative and its being released this October. ',0),(833,'iamElijahWood','Do you agree that Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar?   Also, what was it like eating people in Sin City?','I think his performance is extraordinary. I think if the question is about whether or not a motion capture performer (or performance) should be nominated, or should be considered, the same as another live-action performance, then yes - I think it should be considered. And i think his work in any of the films that hes done as a motion capture artist has been excellent simply as an actor, motion capture aside. And theres no question that he has created one of the most memorable characters of the past decade with Gollum. So should he be recognized for his work as an actor? Absolutely.  Well, in Sin City I didnt actually get to eat anyone - there was no simulation of eating - so unfortunately I didnt even get to have an imagined experience eating the flesh of my victims. ',0),(834,'iamElijahWood',' Why did none of the characters in The Faculty die?  Whats your favorite film?','1.) SPOILER ALERT: I guess they dont die - maybe its just the way that that alien manifests? because it takes over - almost like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS - maybe once that parasite leaves the body, it doesnt kill you. But theres also that thing at the end of the movie where they are all suddenly cool at the end - like my character gets the girl - maybe theyre all actually aliens? Also - special mention - its Robert Rodriguezs birthday today, so happy birthday Robert!  2.) My favorite film - thats a very difficult question. But I tend to - I have a stock answer. Which is HARVIE, with Jimmy Stewart. I go back to that movie a lot. Ive seen it a number of times. There might be films that I actually love more than that, but I love the film and think its really profound and I think it can be enjoyed on multiple levels - its very funny, but its also left for interpretation as to what Harvie is and what is gong on with Jimmy Stewarts character. And WILFRED is actually quite similar in some ways to Harvie. ',0),(835,'iamElijahWood','How did you like your performance in sin city?  Was it fun to play such a creature?','Thank you! It was a blast. I remember sitting down with Robert Rodriguez before they started shooting the feature, and we were at dinner, and he told me that he was adapting a number of the SIN CITY books into a film, and he said  come out to my car, and Ill show you the first scene of the movie.  And he had shot the opening scene with Josh Hartnett as a promo to prove to Frank Miller that it was possible to bring his work to the screen in a way that was true to the comic book. And I was later asked if I would come in and put myself on tape for Kevin, which was hilarious, because Kevin doesnt have any dialogue, so my audition for Robert in a hotel room in LA consisted of me staring at a camera with glasses on whilst he read Marvs dialogue.  ',0),(836,'iamElijahWood','?','There is a painting in my attic that is doing that for me. ',0),(837,'iamElijahWood','Quick question from a friend who doesnt have Reddit but wanted to ask you this undying question:   **Did you get to keep the ring?','Awesome. Yes, I did. Ive got one of the Rings. Peter and Fran gave it to me upon completion of pickups for the first film.  I dont know how many other Rings there are, its a small number - there are a few really large rings they made for close-ups and different perspectives, depending on what they were shooting the ring for. But I have the standard size that I wore around my neck - and I have the chain as well. ',0),(838,'iamElijahWood','In the event of a full-blown zombie apocalypse what weapon would you want to have the most, and what sidekick/partner would you want to have to back you up as you try to survive?    also  if you can turn into any animal at will (and back again) what would you pick and  why?','In a Zombie apocalypse. a flamethrower would be pretty awesome, but the zombies could still walk as theyre on fire. Id go with a shotgun with a flamethrower attachment. Or an assault rifle, because then youve got distance, and you can keep a great amount of distance between you and the zombies as you pick them off.  As far as a sidekick is concerned, I gotta say its not necessarily muscle that you want to rely on in a zombie apocalypse - you need someone sprightly, limber and fast. So the girl in THE WALKING DEAD with the katanas -thats the kind of sidekick you want. In fact, shed be perfect.   If I could turn into any animal - probably a falcon or an eagle, something that could fly. Because then you could quickly get from one place to another. ',0),(839,'iamElijahWood','Which of your roles was the most fun to perform, and why was it Spyro?','So are you basically asking why did I do the voice for Spyro? Because it seemed like a fun videogame to lend a voice to. I like videogames. ',0),(840,'iamElijahWood','Thanks for the AMA Elijah! What was your favourite scene to shoot in the  LOTR trilogy?','I would say that one of the more gratifying scenes to shoot was the scene with Frodo and Sam on the side of Mount Doom, when Sam has to pick Frodo up to take him up the side of the mountain. It was really emotional and difficult, yet it felt really good. And any scene from THE FELLOWSHIP with a large group of us - with the four Hobbits, or with other members - those scenes were always a lot of fun, because we all got along so well. When The Fellowship broke at the end of the first film, in some ways that happened while we were shooting, because different factions were shooting in different sets - so it was always nice to see friends.',0),(841,'iamElijahWood',' None of us wanted to bother you while you were on a date so we left you alone, but after all these years, all of us are dying to know: how did that date end up?','Thats awesome. I was with my then-girlfriend at the time, so it wasnt a first date. We had been dating for a couple of years at that point, but were no longer together. But it was a great trip to Vermont. A retroactive hello, though.',0),(842,'iamElijahWood','Is Ian McKellen as cool as gandalf in real life?','Ian McKellen might be *cooler* than Gandalf. ',0),(843,'iamElijahWood','What is the most common misconception people believe about you, which is not true?','That Im either Daniel Radcliffe or Tobey Maguire. ',0),(844,'iamElijahWood',' What is your current favourite game youve been playing?  Anything youre looking forward to?','I just started playing THE LAST OF US - its *incredible.* Im looking forward to the new QUANTIC DREAM game, and the new CALL OF DUTY as well. And GTA 5. ',0),(845,'iamElijahWood','What kind of music do you play when you deejay?','I play a wide variety of music; everything from old soul and funk records, to international pysch music from Brazil and France and Africa, to recently old disco records and early techno records and disco edits. And then, you know, Ive got old garage rock records too. Pretty much anytime I travel to a new city, the first 2 things Im looking for are record stores and restaurants. ',0),(846,'iamElijahWood','Why didnt you take the eagles straight to Mordor man?','Take it up with J.R.R. Tolkien!',0),(847,'iamElijahWood','If you had to choose between Mr T and Samuel L. Jackson, who would you rather have as a granddad and why?','Samuel L Jackson. I used to watch THE A-TEAM when I was a kid, so I definitely have a love for Mr. T, it was one of my favorite TV shows as a kid. At the end of every episode, I would be so charged with energy I would grab pillows and get out the aggression that the show somehow inspired. But Samuel L Jackson. I dont think you can get more badass. I think he has taken ownership of  Badass  and that definition in a way that has surpassed many people. Hes a cool motherfucker. ',0),(848,'iamElijahWood','Whats it like working with a person who has to act like a dog?','It feels really normal to me now. I think Im kind of like Ryan in that Ive accepted him as a part of my reality. I find the dog-isms (when Wilfred is actually behaving as a dog, but in human form) really funny.   Youre welcome - Im really excited to be doing this AMA!',0),(849,'iamElijahWood',' Did they talk to you about right &amp; wrong?','I was 12 when we made that, and definitely read the script, and had an understanding of what was actually happening. So I was aware of the darkness of Macaulays character, and ultimately what the result at the end of the film is. And I think at that point - I remember reading it and having a sense of morality, and I think even understood that he was probably mentally or emotionally disturbed, I didnt feel like anything had to be explained to me. ',0),(850,'iamElijahWood','I must say I loved the Faculty but LOTR was excellent. I would love to know how working with Hugo Weaving was, I know his roles are generally so serious is he just a downright funny guy or what?','hes a sweetheart. I just recently saw him for the first time in a long time when we were doing promotion for THE HOBBIT. And it reminded me what a kind and gentle soul he is, and very funny, with a great wry sense of humor. The thing is, he can actually be incredibly funny - he was in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILA, so he can be very funny. Not a lot of people know that. ',0),(851,'iamElijahWood','Do you remember the taste of the strawberries mister Frodo?','I do. The Shire has delicious strawberries.',0),(852,'iamElijahWood','Hey Elijah! How were you introduced for the role of Ryan on Wilfred?','I was sent the script from my manager, who had read it and thought it was very funny, and I read it immediately, and it was unlike anything Id ever read before or seen on television. And it made me laugh, and I loved how weird and dark it was. So I just wanted to move forward with it from there. ',0),(853,'iamElijahWood','Whats your favorite movie/tv show?','Favorite television show is probably GAME OF THRONES at the moment, but I cant wait for the last season of BREAKING BAD.  Favorite movie I answered earlier with HARVIE.   And cool - thanks!',0),(854,'iamElijahWood','How hard is it to stay serious while talking to a grown man in a dog costume?','Its not hard, its actually pretty easy. Seeing Jason in the costume is so normal now, that sometimes I forget that it might appear odd to the outside world. Theres a part of Wilfred that is real to me, I think.',0),(855,'iamElijahWood','Hey Elijah. When is the faculty 2 coming out ?','In an alternate universe, it would be cool to have a reunion. Like Joshs character - did he fall apart? Did Casey end up getting into photojournalism, or is he a millionaire from an internet startup? Is he married to Jordana Brewsters character or did he find someone else? Now that I think about it, theres a lot to explore. And the return of the aliens, obviously. ',0),(856,'iamElijahWood','Do you own a dog?  If so what kind?','I would like a dog. I particularly love Labradoodles, which is not exactly the most masculine name of a dog to say -  i want to get a labradoodle!  doesnt exactly sound awesome. But they are beautiful dogs. I love cats too, for the record - I know that people are usually either dog people or cat people, but I am animal ambidextrous. ',0),(857,'iamElijahWood','   What do you do when youre looking for a break from acting?','I spend my time buying records, playing records (which is definitely a creative outlet), and work with my production company keeps me busy. And its good to find time to actually take off, too.  ',0),(858,'iamElijahWood',' Who are your favorite movie psycho killers?','Michael Myers, Leatherface, the devil that possesses Reagan, Hannibal Lecter.Ed Gein has been amalgamized into a variety of different characters (Norman Bates, Leatherface, the list goes on). Oh, and Patrick Bateman, because hes probably my favorite villain from the literary world. I mean, theres no better character than that as far as a psychopath. ',0),(859,'iamElijahWood','    Do you think the dark tones turned people off?','Thats a good question. I think that might have been the case. It was actually written by David Mickey Evans, who wrote and directed THE SANDLOT. I agree, its a film I love, and interestingly enough the original version of the film was far darker than the movie that we made.',0),(860,'iamElijahWood','Whats your favorite ice cream?  And is legolas as hot as he is in the movies?','Coffee ice cream. And thats relatively subjective, I think? He looked the same as he does in the movies in real life when we were filming.',0),(861,'iamElijahWood','  ~~Could you update your twitter with a link to this AMA please?','Sorry for the delay guys!',0),(862,'iamElijahWood','Hi Elijah! As a music lover and a fan of horror films, which horror film would you say has the best soundtrack?','Goblins SUSPIRIA score is awesome. And John Carpenters HALLOWEEN score is incredible. ',0),(863,'thebryancranston','How involved are you with NCMEC?','John Walsh introduced me to the charity many years ago and I just gravitated to it because my daughter was 6-years-old at the time and I felt compelled to actively get involved. Just wanted to say, again thanks for considering making a donation to help NCMEC. Just today the FBI Most Wanted list included a former professor at USC who was making regular trips to the Orient and having sex with little boys. This is how expansive this problem is because its not just the guy in the dirty overcoat you need to be worried about. Theyre very well organized and many are very well-educated. Its a huge problem not just internationally but also domestically.  They have some child pornography cases that includes not even year old children, month old children. Its sickening so every dollar thats donated really goes to help the pedophilia problem on the internet.',0),(864,'thebryancranston','Have you ever pranked Aaron Paul on set?','Oh yeah, many times. There was one episode when where someone was giving us a problem and I told him to take care of it and he didnt know specifically what I meant by it. I said  I need you to take care of it  and I reached into my waistband and pulled out a gun and put it on the counter. He understood the message. Then during the scene where I said  I need you to take care of it  I reached into my waistband and pulled out a dildo.',0),(865,'thebryancranston',' Cranston, have you seen Samuel L Jacksons video where he does your  I am the danger  monologue?    What is it like finishing Breaking Bad?  Are you sad to see it go, or excited to move on and do other projects?','How is the Stig, I wonder? I did see Sammys monologue and Im going to be making one of my own from one of his monologues at some point to help with the Alzheimers research and finding the cure. I sympathize with him because my mother also had Alzheimers and its a horrible disease but he found a very interesting way to bring attention to it.  In a way Im sad to see it go but in another way Im so proud of it. To me its like retiring after winning the Super Bowl.',0),(866,'thebryancranston','What is your all time favorite movie, TV show, and food?','All-time favorite tv show is Breaking Bad, I dont know if you guys have heard of it before. When you say the Godfather, everybody says  oh the Godfather , but it was really remarkable. I loved the Andy Griffith show for its simplicity and warmth, but I also love Louis for its sardonic humor.  My favorite food is typically what I am eating at the time. But if I had to chose one, Id have to go Italian. How can you not love pasta? ',0),(867,'thebryancranston','   My question is, To what degree was the show mapped out beforehand?  Were there any characters (ie Saul, or Mike) that were originally supposed to have smaller roles, but were expanded upon?','Yeah, Jesse was not supposed to survive after the first year. He was a character that was need to introduce me into that world and then he was going to die. But Aaron Paul captured something in him that was so necessary to the fabric of the show that it was a no brainer to keep him. They knew in broad strokes where the character was going to go, but they kept resetting after each season.  ',0),(868,'thebryancranston',' Would you give us YOUR best look in to WWs mind with a line or scene that maybe most people maybe dont give enough attention to?','First of all, happy birthday. Walt says today you be the danger. There was a moment nobody ever really wrote about in the first or second season.when he was in remission from his cancer and he decided even though his hair was growing back, he decided to shave his head some more. And that was  big thing for me because it made a statement that he was truly accepting this new life of his.',0),(869,'thebryancranston',' How did you become involved with NCMEC and what can we, the general public, do to help?  Can you walk us through your process of directing an episode of Breaking Bad?','1. You can start by looking at www.missingkids.com and if you have children, take lots of pictures of them because if god forbid anything happens, the picture is the most important tool to retrieving any child. Thanks for your help and support.  2. Oy, the most important period in directing for me is the pre-production. The more work I get accomplished, the smoother the shoot is. Theres no shortage of hard work. You gotta be willing to put in the time and effort.',0),(870,'thebryancranston','How did it feel to get that pizza throw perfect on the first try?','Well, I would have patted myself on the back but I was holding a pizza. Yeah, I did it in one try. It was a real pizza (a super xtra large) and very heavy. I just got lucky and it landed in the right place on the very first try so we let it be that way.',0),(871,'thebryancranston','   You seem to be such a funny person on and off set - whats it like for you to switch from doing something so funny like Malcolm in the Middle to something so deadly and serious like Breaking Bad? com/watch?','Oh no, they can post those videos. wow. What I discovered is that everyone has a dark side. It might be unrealized, untapped, but if the right buttons are pushed anyone can become dangerous and I just opened up to it. Now I dont want to say that I killed people in preparation for the role. but I cant deny it either.',0),(872,'thebryancranston','Was this whole thing just an elaborate plot by Walt to get Jesse to learn chemistry?','Ha! You know there are many ways to teach people and you just have to find your own way end to stimulate the minds of young people. This was a ruse Walt designed way back when.  someday Ill pretend to be making Crystal method, get him to be my partner. Yessss, thats it. ',0),(873,'thebryancranston','  My question for you is: At what point in the series do you believe Walter White officially broke bad?','My feeling is that Walt broke bad in the very first episode. It was very subtle but he did because thats when he decided to become someone that hes not in order to gain financially. He made the Faustian deal at that point and everything else was a slippery slope.',0),(874,'thebryancranston','What is the most inspirational thing that has ever happened to you?','Well the first thing that comes to mind is the birth of my child. If nothing inspires you to be a better person than to be a father, I dont know what would. And then Id kill her with a crane. Im on a crane kick right now. I like to see things (mostly people) get killed by cranes.',0),(875,'thebryancranston','At certain parts in your life/career, has it ever been difficult to maintain being humble and not egotistical in certain situations?','I think if you were born without promises or come from a middle class or lower middle class environment like I was, you have a benefit of not being entitled. Therefore humility goes along with it. I realize I am very lucky to be doing what I do. ',0),(876,'thebryancranston','What are your thoughts on those two infamous Cousins pulling off the Explosion in one take?','Hi Luis, good to talk to you man. Miss you. And Im happy to be the first person to direct you on the show. You and your brother really contributed greatly.',0),(877,'thebryancranston','Welcome to reddit! What would you be if you werent an actor at first?','Now? I dont know. But I thought about being a police man when I was younger. I was pretty close to becoming one too but in college I took some acting classes and I found that the girls were much prettier there than in police science.',0),(878,'thebryancranston',' Do ever read the script and think to yourself  im playing a real scumbag ?  Does Hank flush?','First of all Mr. Pickles. Thanks for pointing out our age difference. you little shit. Speaking of that, no he doesnt flush. And further more I think Walt is just misunderstood. Hes a lovely person.',0),(879,'thebryancranston',' Im curious how you feel about our city overall?  Also what were some of your favorite places to frequent while in town?','Albuquerque became a very important part of the show and I really enjoyed my time there. I look forward to going back at some point. You know, strolling central in Nob Hill, Church St. Cafe in Old Town, El Pinto is another place I go. And I ride for miles along the Bosque.',0),(880,'thebryancranston','Whats it like working with Aaron Paul?','Its in the past now but that was one of the saddest things, to realize that was coming to the end.

But still damn fun.',0),(883,'thebryancranston','  Do you happen to be a Steely Dan fan?','Yeah, I am.

That was a Conan experience so youll have to Google that.',0),(888,'thebryancranston','Have you watched all of the series? ? ?','I have seen every episode at least once. But I am able to watch it with some detachment. I am not one of those actors cant watch myself or highly criticize myself.

On a side note, Giancarlo Esposito seems like such a peaceful and kind person in real life and I was wondering what it was like working with him?','Giancarlo is such the antithesis of his character Gus. Gus was calculating and always had an agenda to advance himself personally. And Giancarlo is an open warm loving caring man.

Inception was an incredible experience. I am grateful to Chris for writing such a great role for a young woman and for letting me be involved. I would LOVE to work with him again.   Tequila and water :) ',0),(903,'iamatinycanadian','How close is real-life Michael Cera to his persona in *This is the End*?','I havent seen the movie yet.

No signs of coke or sex addict activity. ',0),(904,'iamatinycanadian','Do you play video games?   If so, what is your favorite one?','I played video games more when I was a kid. I had Sega Genesis and was a HUGE Sonic fan. I also love the NHL games and played them with my brother all time. Then I was super into Playstation and loved the FIFA games.  I recently played my first video game in a while. I played the latest Tomb Raider and really enjoyed it, finished in about 12 hours. ',0),(905,'iamatinycanadian','How did you manage to get into character in Hard Candy?','Most important thing was to not judge Hayley and completely understand her anger and her mission.

Also, as an old school lego nerd, what are your opinons on the ever expanding line of specialist shapes available?  Are you a bricks only purist or do you embrace the creative possibilities that these new and unique shapes represent?','On the specialist shapes - We use all available lego parts including the specialist shapes. More parts to work with! LEGO have a cap of about 7000 different parts, with colour combinations at anyone time, and they stick to that. When something new comes in, something old goes out. Variety is the spice of life, and we need to find a way of working with all of LEGOs parts. We LOVE every part, from bricks to minifigs skeletons! ',0),(938,'BrightBricks','What has been the most challenging project you have ever taken on and why?','Our most challenging project was the Trent 1000 jet engine. This was mostly due to having to design it to function as the model, which involved engineering a way to counter rotate compressors within the engine, as well as designing the shape of the fanblades! There is also a timelapse of the project on Rolls-Royces youtube page, [linked here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9uf99bQvLU&amp;feature=player_embedded)  Edit: Grammer and linked properly ',0),(939,'BrightBricks','What goes into becoming a Lego Certified Professional?

',0),(941,'BrightBricks','What was it like working with James May on his fantastic full size Lego house?  Did you guys build it with an intent for someone to actually live in it or was it always an art installation?','It was good fun, we were there to provide technical know how and assistance, but it was primairly designed as a One off TV stunt, so unforunately it was just a art installation.   Did have a flush loo though ;) ',0),(942,'BrightBricks','What kind backgrounds do your employees come from?','From all sorts of backgrounds, from design to sound engineering and video editing.

Other than that, We are capable of building ANYTHING!!! :) ',0),(948,'BrightBricks','    What are your thoughts on using non-Lego for structural work?   When doing a commission, do you use glue, or internal structure made of non-Lego (wood, metal, etc) to help support things?','We try to avoid using anything other than LEGO as much as possible, for health and safety we do have to put steel inside sometimes.   Ed says thank you! :) ',0),(949,'BrightBricks','What would you not build for anyone for any price?','We have guidelines from LEGO from what we are allowed to build, were not allowed to build anything inappropiate such as drugs and alcohol etc. ',0),(950,'BrightBricks','Do you have to spend a lot of time on structural analysis and such to make sure a large model doesnt break apart during the design process?','Yes we do.

At the time everyone was REALLY excited. For people who had been there for a long time, it meant that a lot of the bonuses they had been accruing would finally pay off. The rest of us were happy to be a part of a company that was gonna hit big and we were on the ground floor. All that quickly dissipated after the stock plummeted from $15 to $8 by the first selling window. Now the stock has lingered around $3 for 8 months. Its kind of a joke. Everyone kinda hopes it will go up, but at the same time everyone knows theres no guarantee.   As for the copying, I feel Ive touched on that in other comments. But if you have specific additional questions, let me know.  The culture was.weird. At least for me. Ive never been a corporate kind of person. So it was hard to adjust. One of the weirder things was the obsession with dogs.  I like dogs. Theyre great. I grew up with them. Never really wanted to take one to work. But its highly encouraged there. And kind of obsessed over. Some of the dogs were cool. Some were barking assholes I wanted to punch in the face. Its kind of like a crying baby on an airplane. It sucks, and theres nothing you can do about it.   Beyond all that, the culture had a major dichotomy. There were the people that saw through the bullshit and were there to get a paycheck and take advantage of what was offered. And there were those who loved the company and everything they did and truly believed in the company mission and every game that launched. From my perspective, more people that made the games were in the cynical camp, and more people that worked in the support groups (HR, legal, etc) were in the spirit squads. But thats not a hard rule.',0),(970,'former_zyngite','Do you think they have a sound business strategy?','Oh hell no. Their business strategy is terrible.   Their major issues are the inability to adjust to the changing market. They did great when Facebook gaming was on the rise, but now its declining and Mobile is on the rise. Theyre trying to change over, but employ too many of the same game development  best practices  that were developed for Facebook games. These just dont translate to the mobile market, which is why theyre suffering in that market.   Theres also lots of other issues internally.   A lot of micro-management from the top down that stifles the creativity and hinders the production of many games.   An over reliance on every game being a blockbuster hit which makes the fun aspect of games suffer while making the money grabbing tactics all too transparent to the users.  And a serious lack of foresight over all. Too many major decisions are quick reactions to sudden changes in the market. If some games jumps to the top of the Top Grossing charts then everyone need to drop everything and change to follow it. Which wastes time, makes for bad design and ultimately puts projects behind schedule. It just means theyre always late to the party, and whatever game theyre trying to compete with has already faded away by the time their own version hits the market.   They rely too much on reacting to what is making money now, and too much on their own data. They dont strive to make anything new or innovative and thats no way to excel in the games market. You need to lead the pack, not try emulate the best practices of top games with the hopes that you can out perform and already established IP.',0),(971,'former_zyngite','I never played any of their games because I could see everything was a clone or designed to make me buy stuff. Was there anything the staff felt was actually worth playing?','Oh yeah. I mean a lot of the people there genuinely loved the games. I was never really a fan either, but there were some that I played.   I think that a lot of freemium games suffer from the obvious fact that theyre asking for money. But thats what you get from a free game, right? I mean Zynga wasnt making games to be charitable. Its a business. So the games they provided were free, and most people never paid. And for them that was fine.   I think a lot of gamers look at that with disdain because they hate the idea of paying to win. It takes the sport out of the game and makes it unfair. If I could pay $1 and win a deathmatch round of Halo Id be a cheating asshole. But thats because everyone playing Halo already dropped $60 to play that game and its also just not fair.   The playing field for freemium games is different. Farmville isnt a deathmatch. Its a solo grind that requires players to spend time and spam their friends to advance. If you dont want to do either, you can spend a dollar. The general attitude with freemium is that if youre going to pay us, well let you skip through the game as fast as you want. Because, who cares? We get the money, and you get to save some time. We both win.   Im not saying its for everyone. But theres clearly a market for this kinda gaming. ',0),(972,'former_zyngite',' Do you know anything about that?','Yeah, they want to get into real money gambling. Heres the issues.  Its been legal in other countries for years. The companies that have been working those markets were the ones to pioneer and legitimize those markets.   Zynga is hopping in late. They have launched RMG (real money gambling) in the countries where its currently legal, but theyre not the first to the market.  They are pushing the legislation to make it legal in the US. But if it passes, there are other companies who have been doing it longer and better than zynga who will jump on the US market first. Zynga might jump on at the same time, but who are you going to trust your real money with? The company that has been managing online casinos for a decade or the company that is trying to jump into it now?   I dont blame Zynga for going after this market, and I honestly believed this could be the saving grace for Zynga. But they are Johnny-come-lately to this market.   In theory, they might be able to make tons of money on RMG. But in reality, there are a dozen other companies that have been doing it longer and better. ',0),(973,'former_zyngite','  If there are any, were there any games that looked great on paper and you thought  was going to be great, but in reality didnt work?   Any games you thought was going to be a succes, but got scraped?','Youre welcome, and thank you!  Yes. Honestly most of the games look great on paper. But thats kinda true of every game ever. Ideas are great. But once you play it, sometimes its not actually as great as it seems.   There was one in mobile that was a dragonvale style game. You bred dragons. But it also had an angry birds component. You used the dragons to fire different kinds of fireballs at pirate ships that were encroaching on your territory. In theory it seemed great. Sounded totally fun. In reality it was kind of a Frankenstein of both games and neither part worked because  both aspects were tacked on by the executive staff late in the dev cycle.   There always seemed to be a lot of games like that. They were 70% awesome. They just needed a little push to make them great. But the teams werent left alone to make the final adjustments. Someone up top would always feel like they knew what had to be done. So some major (and often uninformed) changes were pushed on the team and they would be forced to change features that would ultimately disrupt the rest of the game and cause the entire project to fail. ',0),(974,'former_zyngite','Just how prolific is their theft of other games?','Thats a broad question. But it varies. They got a lot better recently. After The Ville got sued by EA it was much less okay to  fast follow  a game (The term for copying a game).   I think that early on it was blatant. Later it became well known practice at Zynga, but rather poor taste. Dream Heights/Tiny Tower was a big slap in the face. Sims Social/The Ville was the last straw. Towards the end of my time it was not so much that games were straight up ripped off, but key features would be. Such as the general method or menu flow that a game handles its multiplayer. The idea being that if it works for that game, it would work for our game.  In general though, most of us knew what game was copying what. Bubble Safari was a copy of Bubble Witch Saga. The Ville was Sims Social. Hidden Chronicles was Gardens of Time. The company didnt call it out for what it was, but you knew because whatever project you were on most likely had similar pressures to match and beat a game on the market. ',0),(975,'former_zyngite','Tell us about the highs and lows of departmental competition would you?  Wasnt it encouraged by zynga?','It wasnt necessarily encouraged. It wasnt like the midcore division was trying to out perform the casual gaming division.   But ultimately you wanted to make a game that went live and made tons of money. If you did you got all the best perks.   There were things that were available to everyone in the company, like the gym and free food. But if you were on a top grossing team then you got additional perks, like trips to Vegas and other off-site excursions.   The problem being that some games inherently had better opportunities for success. Farmville 2 was destined to succeed as it had all the best of the best working on it and every spare dollar thrown at it. Smaller games had to perform at the same level with fewer resources and a smaller time frame.   There was always the chance that your small game could blow up and be huge. But odds were that if you were on a Farmville or Poker game, you were going to do much better than someone on an unproven new IP. ',0),(976,'former_zyngite','General business practice to not  reinvent the wheel , however do you think it was a bad business move to actually make the idea taking so noticable?   How much rework is done on a video game besides just the remaining of the game?','If I understand you correctly, youre asking how much more work is done beyond just copying a game?   It always sounds so simple. Like youre just going to copy a game the same way youd throw a document on a Xerox machine and press a button. Its not that simple. Maybe a few games were that obviously blatant, but most werent. There were a lot of aspects that were reused. Maybe the layout of a menu. The general design of a feature (or core loop of a game). But for the most part, everything was still made from scratch.  If the games were just straight up copies, it would be a lot easier. But no one on the teams actually wants to do that. So they try to make the content as original as possible. So the game takes as long to make as any other game would. ',0),(977,'former_zyngite','Do you know any dirty secrets or scandals about the company ?','Nothing that probably hasnt already been reported. I think the worst during my time was the law suit against the c-staff for insider knowledge. When the company went public the shares were $10. At their peak they were $15 and the c-staff had a special clause that allowed them to sell early. They sold something like 15 or 20% of their shares when the stocks were at their highest. By the time employees could sell for the first time it had dropped to $8 a share. After that window closed, the stock price had dropped to $4 or $5  by the next time employees could sell. I guess the investors were pissed that the top brass made out like bandits and everyone else got screwed. ',0),(978,'former_zyngite','What (if anything) do you think they did right as a company?','They really try hard to keep morale high. They give so many perks that you really get accustomed to it. I ate two out of three meals for free at work every day. It was awesome. And they provided healthy options! They promoted volunteering. Going green. They really tried hard to be a good place to work and a socially conscious company. In that way, theyre really great.   On the games side of things I think their whole concept of pulling data on everything players do is amazing. However their over reliance on that is not so amazing. It made the development very analytical, and less intuitive. Its easy to tell when a game is fun. Its hard to pull data on that though.',0),(979,'former_zyngite','Was buying Draw-Something really worth it for Zynga?','No. It was a major financial fuck up.   Whether or not people stopped playing because Zynga bought OMGPop was minimal.  The problem was that they paid top dollar for a game/studio that had already hit their peak. At the time Zynga was on top of the world and had money to burn. They burned that money on a studio/game that held huge potential and didnt pan out. Its no fault of OMGPop. They cashed out at the best time possible. But Zynga had a tendency to buy better games than they could make.   Zynga bought Words with Friends and Draw Something. I challenge you to name a game that they made that did better and is better known. Theres one game that did better, but those two are the best known games and both were shitty money makers. ',0),(980,'former_zyngite',' What do you think?  Would you like to continue in the social gaming industry or youd prefer to take your creative talents elsewhere?','Well Zyngas major focus now is Mobile. Theyre just not making a great transition into it. Theyre great at Facebook games, but its just not the same thing.  I wouldnt mind staying in social gaming. I started in consoles. One thing I really miss is having a physical copy of the product Ive helped to create. Its nice being able to grab someones iPhone and direct them to the game youve made and make them download it for free. But when that game gets cancelled, it no longer exists. ANYWHERE. Thats pretty depressing.   I honestly dont care where I work, as long as I enjoy what Im doing and feel passionate about what Im making. Mobile.console.As long as someone out there enjoys what Im creating, Im happy.',0),(981,'former_zyngite','Did you have a feeling previously that you were going to be laid off?  Are they providing you benefits to help find another job?','I had no idea this was coming. Totally out of the blue. I knew things werent great at the company but I wasnt expecting layoffs at this point and I wasnt expecting to be part of it if it did happen. I did get a nice severance package and benefits. So Im pretty well set for a while and I have a lot of friends and former co-workers in other parts of the industry. So Ive got a lot of leads already.',0),(982,'former_zyngite','Are the top brass really as big of assholes as they seem?','In general, theyre all fairly good guys. However I think theres a lot of the old c-staff that came to Zynga for the money. Theyre guys who made a name in the industry working on big games, saw an opportunity to make some big bucks in a new market, hopped in, cashed out and took off. The guys that are still around are doing what they can, but its kind of like trying to sail a sinking ship. Everyone has ideas on how to change things, and each new change makes more problems. ',0),(983,'former_zyngite','How do you feel about the revolving door mentality for employees working in a lot of development studios (basically as soon as the game gets done there is a mass layoff)?','Its the worst aspect of working in the industry, easily. Its an unstable industry and you have to accept that youre going to lose your job, and change companies multiple times throughout your career.  Some people in normal industries can get a job, work there for 40 years and retire. Thats virtually impossible in the games industry. ',0),(984,'former_zyngite','Why do you think you were one of the laid-off people?  Was it random or were you involved in a failed or not-so-successful project?','For me I know that I was low-man on the totem pole. I was a valuable and well like person in my team. My boss is actively attempting to find me a new job. But the fact is that the few people on my team were crucial to continued development, where as I was a support aspect to the team.',0),(985,'former_zyngite','What kind of snacks were in the break room?','Depends on the room, but the basics were granola bars, cookies, liquorish bites, kettle chips, pop chips, pretzel bites, hard boiled eggs, cereal, nuts, chex mix, coffee and tea.',0),(986,'former_zyngite','What are your plans for finding a new job?  Will you work in the same industry considering the plummeting job market?','Im currently taking some time to consider all my options. The industry is rough. Theres always that looming threat of getting laid off. And it sucks. I know theres no guarantee in any job. But Im considering looking to other industries where my skills would be applicable. But if I get offered a great game industries job, I wouldnt turn it down. Its still a fun and exciting industry. The stability is just crap. ',0),(987,'former_zyngite','What are the benefits of working at Zynga?','Lots of perks, like a gym in the building, three free meals a day, happy hour every Friday with free booze, unlimited vacation days. Not everyone takes advantage of them all. I loved getting a free 15 minute massage once a week. ',0),(988,'former_zyngite','Did they offer separation package?','Yep. I cant say for sure that everyone got what I did. But I got four months salary plus an additional week for each partial year. I worked almost two years, so I got 4.5 months paid. Plus insurance is paid on top of that. ',0),(989,'former_zyngite','How much longer will Zynga be around for?','Hard to say. At this rate, Id give them another 2 to 3 years. They make money and have a lot in the bank. But they also throw away money like you wouldnt believe.  If they actually manage to change their strategy and start putting out some big hits, they could be around a lot longer.',0),(990,'former_zyngite','Do you have have unlimited energy on all the Zynga games?','Nope. We had to pay like everyone else. ',0),(991,'former_zyngite','What percent of users actually pay real money in Zynga games?','Depends on the game, but on average I think its about 5%. Maybe less.

Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I m sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it s difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I m not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You re right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn t help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent s plan until you re twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that s why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we ve put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don t promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don t be discouraged - we didn t get into this fix overnight, and we won t get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mom8)\n&gt;What s the recipe for the White House s beer?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnz9)\n&gt;What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn t revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmg8)\n&gt;What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban s momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm2v)\n&gt;What is the first thing you ll do on November 7th, win or lose?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Win or lose, I ll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60ml11)\n&gt;How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;We ve really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm5n)\n&gt;Who s your favourite Basketball player?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Jordan - I m a Bulls guy.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)\n&gt;We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you d push to add to the Democratic Party s 2012 platform?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won t stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm41)\n&gt;Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmaf)\n&gt;How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;It s hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I m spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I m in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I m back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run.

The way our voting system works today means that only those with the most money get their voice heard, and those who can t pander to the large spenders will not.  The only way to truly fix the election system is for PUBLICLY FUNDED ELECTIONS.  Elections should not be about who is best at gathering money, but who has the opinions and goals that he people want, these two are not, and should not be one in the same.  ANY donation should be considered a bribe.  All candidates should get EQUAL air time, all candidates should get EQUAL money to spend as they will on advertisements and their campaign, all candidates should have an EQUAL chance to be heard across the nation, regardless of how rich they are, or their friends.  The only way to have a true representative democracy is through a system like this.  Until this happens money will always influence elections in a way that is NOT beneficial to the people.  How can the people EVER trust their government knowing they are constantly taking bribes from the wealthy.  Fix this ONE issue and 90% of the other issues about corruption will slowly fade away.  I implore you, PLEASE do something about this!  Simply creating some minor law about capping donations and such is simply not enough.\n\nI don t know if you will even see this as this conversation is already over, but one can only hope...',1820),(20,'PresidentObama','Dudester_XCIC','n','&gt;All candidates should get EQUAL air time, all candidates should get EQUAL money to spend as they will on advertisements and their campaign\n\n*All* candidates? Do you realize just how many presidential candidates there are? There is a nice little list [here](http://www.politics1.com/p2012.htm). In terms of advertising, if we assume that the total time advertisements are shown stays the same, that leaves next to no time for any individual candidate. To reform this, how would you solve the problem? Only give funding to certain parties candidates? That would be even worse that our current system. And that is saying something, because our current system is awful. This idea works in theory the same way our current system does.',282),(21,'PresidentObama','GESTICULATING_WILDLY','n','TIL Roseanne Barr and a dude named Merlin are both running for president.',149),(22,'PresidentObama','RobbieGee','n','Bah!

The point you bring up is an extremely good one, and absolutely must he addressed in a very clear way for people to have faith in this sort of system, but fortunately that work was done by those who went before us. \n\nNow, I m not a political science if civics expert so I don t claim to know what all of the solutions which have been tried are, not which were more successful. I can say that the one system I know of for publicly funded elections involves a sort of primary system but not (as primaries would also have to be publicly funded else the bribery would just happen there). It essentially is that (to use a small example of a gubernatorial race) a candidate would have to prove that they have a significant amount of support in whatever jurisdiction they are running (in my example a state) to justify getting public monies. So for example there is an election to be held in North Dakota for governor and there are 15 people who wish to run. These people, by whatever deadline happens to be chosen, would be required to gather 5% of the voting populations signatures (% can be adjusted however the citizens choose) from each district in the jurisdiction, in this case 5% from each county in ND. Now that is the voting population, so it is 5% of the total number of voters in the previous governors election (even if there are 5 million citizens but only 500,000 voted, they would only need 25,000 signatures). This demonstrates that there is enough citizen support for that person to be a serious candidate without setting the bar so high that only the major parties can clear it. \n\nNow that works in state and local elections, because the total number of signatures and amount if ground is limited so no huge sum if money must be spent to gather the signatures. But it wouldn t work for presidential elections because it would still cost many 10 s of millions to get that many signatures from every state in the nation. So on that I don t know specifically what a national system may look like, I do know they exist in most countries but I haven t read enough to know the details.

His answer was the same populist  We are going to hold the embargo to spread democracy and freedom  bullshit thats been said by every president to uphold the criminal embargo, including McCain. \n\nThe embargo does nothing but hurt Cuba and its citizens by restricting beneficiary trade, and even much needed medical supplies that Cuba needs. Its been consecutively voted against by the UN by a vote of ~192-2 (being the US and Israel).\n\nThe mere fact that the Obama thinks that the US has the power to decide another country s well being on the guise of  spreading democracy , I think is quite telling, and why I much more prefer Ron Paul s views on American foreign policy. The US prior to the Cuban Revolution had supported the Batista dictatorship, as US investors had much stake in Cuban land. The embargo was hence initiated to protect American interests by immediately thwarting and disabling its socialist neighbor before it ever even had the chance. Later the CIA tried to overthrow Castro with multiple assassination attempts and an invasion, while decades later still aiding anti-Castro militants. The Cuban Five still remained jailed.

I am a third year law student.  I am also a supporter of Marijuana reform.  I even got busted for felony possession w/intent to deliver a few years ago.  I also am heavily involved in politics, and run an organization that hosts events where paid speakers talk about issues of the day.  Earlier this year, our organization invited Drug Policy legal expert, Alex Kreit, to come talk about Marijuana and the Law.  I asked him the question that you are attempting to ask President Obama.  I will now paraphrase what he told us:\n\nObama does not have the amount of control over local federal authorities that your questions presupposes.  Obama *did* promise that he wouldn t interfere with individual state decisions on medical use of cannabis.  In fact, after being elected, his administration (specifically, Eric Holder, I believe) published the Ogden Memo (Google it).  This memo basically directed local federal authorities to respect the states with medical marijuana laws, and not prosecute anyone as long as they are not in violation of the state medical marijuana laws.  *However*, local federal authorities ignored the Ogden memo, and there was not much the Obama administration could do about it.  The way Alex Kreit put it was to say there are not many  levers to pull  for the Obama administration, and that the positions that the local federal authorities hold (U.S. Attorneys, for example) were specifically designed so as to maintain independence from central control.\n\nBasically, as a result of all this, it s not really accurate to blame Obama for the fact that local federal authorities are shutting down dispensaries and arresting people.',671),(112,'PresidentObama','akreit','n','Alex Kreit here.  Someone just let me know about this thread.  Thanks for the plug.  Just wanted to clarify that my comments were specifically about the ability of the Obama admin to try to encourage compliance with the Ogden memo.  Rob Mikos has published a fairly thorough &lt;a href= http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1768127 &gt;law review article&lt;/a&gt; that discusses this issue and explains why the Ogden memo did not really provide any protection. \n\nThat said, it is also important to recognize that Obama could have done other things on this issue but hasn t.  For example, Obama could have picked better appointees--particularly to head the DEA.  He chose extremist drug warrior and Bush holdover Michele Leonhart for the job.  As some may remember, this summer Leonhart refused to admit that heroin and crack are more dangerous than marijuana.  Obama certainly could have made a better pick for the position.  He could have asked prospective nominees point-blank if they would honor the Ogden memo.  Instead, by nominating Leonhart, he all but guaranteed that the Ogden memo would be ignored by the DEA.  I think that the willingness of US Attorneys to ignore the Ogden memo also speaks poorly to them as appointees.  I think a fair US Attorney would have tried to honor Ogden s memo in good faith, even if he or she wasn t obligated to follow it.  Clearly, many of them simply ignored it.  Obama s administration could also have supported one or more of the congressional proposals to protect state medical marijuana laws.  To my knowledge, they ve done nothing to back these proposals.  The list could go on.  \n\nSo, are President Obama and Eric Holder spearheading a coordinated strategy against medical marijuana?  I don t think there s any evidence of that.  I believe people who think otherwise may not have a full understanding of the relationship between the DOJ in DC and local federal law enforcement (again, Rob Mikos discusses this relationship in his excellent article.)  My best guess is that Holder genuinely hoped people would comply with the Ogden memo.  I imagine that Obama himself has probably given this issue hardly any attention (certainly he seems to do everything he can to avoid talking or thinking about this issue based on the lengths he goes to to ignore drug policy questions in public forums.)  But, are Obama appointees like Michele Leonhart and local US Attorneys cracking down on medical marijuana?  Obviously they are.  And, if Obama had nominated people who agreed with the Ogden memo in the first place, then there would never have been an issue about compelling compliance with it.    \n\nAnyway, those are only brief thoughts--it s impossible to convey all the nuances in an internet comments thread.  :)  But, I figured I would chime in to clarify the referenced comments of mine a bit.
